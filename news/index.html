				<h2>Interview in the Ottawa Sun</h2>

				<p>Not everyone gets a second chance. And not all of us grab the opportunity when it presents itself.</p>
                <p>But Ottawa author Deborah Jackson made the most of hers.</p>
                <p>When Jackson penned her first novel, there was no such thing as   e-books. To get published required a lot of work. Find an editor, find   an agent, maybe, find a publisher. After you jump through all those   necessary hoops, you hope the book sells.</p>
              <p>Jackon&rsquo;s Ice Tomb did sell. Enough to convince her that she had a   career in writing even if the money coming in suggested otherwise. But   thanks to e-books, Ice Tomb has a second life and it&rsquo;s convinced Jackson   that e-books are a necessary tool in the writer&rsquo;s toolkit.</p>

				<h2>Article in the Oscar</h2>

				<p>Deborah Jackson&rsquo;s last book, &ldquo;The Ice Tomb&rdquo; [reviewed in the September, 2004 OSCAR], combined history, science and some well-drawn characters in a captivating story. Those characters, however, were all adults. Here, she follows a similar strategy, but for a younger audience. Sarah and Matt Barnes might be your youngster&rsquo;s classmates&hellip; </p>

				<h2>Article in MORE Magazine</h2>

				<p>LIFE BEFORE THE LEAP For 15 years, Deborah Jackson had a routine: three or four shifts a week as a nurse at the Civic Campus of the Ottawa Hospital, with the rest of her time devoted to caring for her family &ndash; husband Brian, a computer analyst, and their daughter and son. She worked in thoracic surgery for 10 years before switching to the hospital&rsquo;s dialysis unit&hellip; </p>

				<h2>Article in the Ottawa Citizen</h2>

				<p>Five years ago, Deborah Jackson gave up her nursing career to write science fiction. &quot;I'd been writing for years, on and off, but only getting short stories done ... I needed time to work on a novel,&quot; says the 43-year-old author, who lives in Orleans with her husband and two children. Losing the income of a steady job was a nerve-racking prospect&hellip;</p>

				<h2>Deborah Jackson Visits Sir Wilfred Laurier High School</h2>

				<p>When she came to Sir Wil to do a reading of Time Meddlers on Thursday, February 15th, she did more than entertain the students with excerpts from her novel.  She also explained the extensive research she did investigating the cultures of the First Nations peoples who lived in the areas around the Ottawa Valley...</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Getting boys interested in reading isn't easy. Most childhood literacy studies agree, as do many parents and teachers. David Mainwood has taught Grade Six students at Maple Ridge Elementary School for about five years. He's experienced firsthand the struggles of getting young male students interested in a book...&rdquo; </p>
