			<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Jackson was thoroughly prepared for her school visit. The presentation was tangible and practical for high school students. She explained not only the importance of thorough research for writers, but gave illustrated examples of her own efforts in that department and how to develop a fictional story from fact. She frankly discussed the virtues and frustrations of the writing process and encouraged the students to both read and write what they are passionate about.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;As a classroom teacher I was looking for a novel that would be appeal to a large number of interests as well as abilities. I found that in your novel. The chapters were short, which kept the students interested, and the book was written at a level that was easy to understand. The use of historical facts combined with real-life personal issues and continuous unpredictable action kept my students riveted and reading on. This book is an excellent way to do some cross curricular teaching in grade 6 as it ties in perfectly with that grade's social studies curriculum, but it is a great read at the intermediate level too! We had Deborah visit our class as a wrap-up after reading the novel and the students highly enjoyed the many historical artifacts that she brought as well as her presentation on what it takes to write a book and be a writer. It was great to be able to take advantage of the opportunity to incorporate the experience of meeting an actual author in real life!&rdquo;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;I never had read a book that I&rsquo;ve liked until this one! Before I read this book, I thought of reading as homework or a chore. I never read for a pastime, I was what you would call a &ldquo;Couch potato&rdquo;. Soon after I started reading it, I would stay up WAY past my bedtime to read saying to myself &ldquo;Ok, just one more page.&rdquo; I would bring it in the car every were I went. As soon as I finished the book, I went to the beginning and read it again. I am proud to say that this is by far the BEST book that I&rsquo;ve ever read. And it&rsquo;s going to stay that way until she makes <em>a Time Meddlers 2</em>!&rdquo;</p>

			<p class="byline">&ndash; Sarah. R, age 11</p>

			<p>&ldquo;An avid reader myself, I always tried to get my children to read in addition to what they were assigned in school. After purchasing book after book which my eldest daughter would promptly turn her nose up to and discard, I finally stumbled upon TIME MEDDLERS and she was hooked on reading for good. Thank you, Deborah, for finally getting my daughter to love books&hellip;almost as much as I do.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;I would like to share a few comments about your book with you. I found your book was quite interesting; it had something that no other book I've ever read before. I myself have quite a few problems just like one of your main characters, Matt Barnes. The reason I liked your book was because the setting kept on changing and the characters moved around a lot and kept the story interesting. Thank you for writing such an intriguing book!&rdquo;</p>
