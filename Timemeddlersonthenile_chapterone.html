		    <h2><strong>Chapter One</strong></h2>
            <h2>Cretaceous Park</h2>
            <p>Sarah parted the leaves of the gigantic fern and peered out at the  riverbank. A duckbill dinosaur was directly in front of her, dipping its muzzle  into the water for a drink. She glanced back at Matt, who was being far too  noisy, rustling leaves and crackling dead branches beneath his feet.</p>
            <p>&quot;Matt,&quot;  Sarah squeaked. She wrenched him backward as the duckbill raised its head and  examined them suspiciously.</p>
            <p>&quot;It's  okay, Sarah. It's only a plant-eater.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;A  plant-eater that's big enough to crush you with its feet, or one swipe of its  tail. This is crazy. What are we doing?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Dad  is here, just past that clump of trees. I'm sure of it.&quot; Matt pointed to a  spot in the forest congested with cypress and palm trees.</p>
            <p>&quot;Right,&quot;  said Sarah. &quot;It looks like the Everglades, but it sure isn't. Why couldn't  we rescue your father in a safer time period?&quot;</p>
            <p>She  couldn't believe he had roped her into another mad adventure, not in a war this  time, but in the Alberta badlands 60 million years in the past. She remembered  visiting Dinosaur National Park several years ago with her parents&mdash;the crumpled  and scarred desert-like hills where one of the world's most renowned collection  of dinosaur fossils had been unearthed. Her visit had been one of the greatest  thrills of her life. Now, here she was, in a tropical jungle of vivid greens  and yellows and reds, a landscape so remote from the badlands that it seemed  like she'd stepped from the moon into the Amazon rainforest. The thrill was  lost to her. All she could feel was the clench of her teeth and the sickness in  her belly.</p>
            <p>The  duckbill eyed them one more time, then spun around. Sarah dove on Matt as its  tail slashed the air just where his head had been. They crashed to the ground,  nearly disappearing beneath the plush carpet of leaves.</p>
            <p>Matt  turned his head and spat out some rotting plant material, coughing and hacking,  enough to wake a field full of dinosaurs. &quot;Wha'you do that for?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;What  do you think I did that for? The dinosaur was about to take your head off with  its tail.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Oh,&quot;  said Matt, sounding somewhat humbled. &quot;Thanks.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;You're  welcome. Now can we get out of here?&quot;</p>
            <p>Matt  didn't answer. He swiveled his head to the side as a crackling, zapping sound  penetrated the undergrowth. &quot;There he is,&quot; he said, pointing toward a  flattened clump of ferns where streaks of flesh and linen had suddenly  appeared. Matt's father emerged, wrapped in a Roman toga and looking every bit  as imposing as Julius Caesar. Another figure, with jet-black hair and a jagged  pale face, similarly draped in linen, appeared at the same instant. &quot;And  there's Nadine,&quot; he snarled.</p>
            <p>Sarah  felt a shiver ripple through her at the sight of the woman.</p>
<p>&quot;And  there's an Albertosaurus,&quot; Sarah hissed under her breath, indicating the  enormous lumbering dinosaur trampling the small trees and creating deep  depressions in&nbsp; the mud farther along the  riverbank.</p>
            <p>&quot;Hey,  T Rex's cousin.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;I  hope your father doesn't get eaten.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Wouldn't  mind if Nadine did, though,&quot; said Matt. &quot;Let's grab Dad, then wait  for the computer to jack us out of here.&quot;</p>
            <p>Matt  leaped to his feet, prepared to dash through the screen of vegetation and grab  his father. At the same time Nadine screamed, &quot;What is that?&quot; Her  eyes bugged out as the Albertosaurus approached, letting loose an earsplitting  roar.</p>
            <p>Nadine  charged into the mesh of growth as Matt made an equally fervent attempt to race  toward his father. They met in the middle, an explosion of creamy white and  bleached blue where toga met jeans and T-shirt. Both of them fell backward,  Nadine managing to land in the large pile of dino excrement deposited by the  duckbill before it had fled. There was a squelching sound as Nadine shrieked  and squirmed, now waist deep in the mound of dung.</p>
            <p>&quot;Wh&mdash;what  happened?&quot; Her eyes ballooned when she spied Matt. &quot;You!&quot;</p>
            <p>Matt  shook his head as the shock wore off and eyed her sideways, his mouth twisting  into a self-satisfied grin. &quot;Exactly where I expected to find you.&quot;</p>
            <p>Nadine  scrambled to her feet, shaking the deposits from her hands with a grimace. Matt  jumped up too, keeping a wary eye on her.</p>
            <p>&quot;Wish  I still had my gun,&quot; she muttered.</p>
            <p>&quot;Yeah,  I suppose so,&quot; said Matt, &quot;'cause I'm bigger than you now.&quot;</p>
            <p>Another roar made him start and turn back to his father. &quot;Dad, over here!&quot;  he yelled.</p>
            <p>Nathan  Barnes had his eyes fixed on the dinosaur, his body immobile. &quot;If I don't  move .&nbsp; . .&quot; he said.</p>
            <p>&quot;What  if it's not like <em>Jurassic Park</em>?&quot;  yelled Matt. &quot;What if he can see you just fine without having to track  movement?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Right,&quot;  said his dad, making a split-second decision and diving into the bushes just as  the giant beast snapped its jaws. Matt reached out for him and pulled him  farther into the ferns. The dinosaur nosed the tree above them, searching for  his escaped prey, while Nadine scrambled away from a massive claw. It smashed  down right where she'd been standing, flattening a magnolia tree and  splattering dino droppings in all directions, coating Nadine even more  emphatically.</p>
            <p>&quot;Matt,  what are you doing here?&quot; gasped his father. &quot;Haven't you learned  anything? Cretaceous period, for goodness sake.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;What  do you think I'm doing? I'm trying to save you before you get eaten, or killed,  or something else nasty. I'm trying to save you from <em>her</em> too.&quot; He jerked his head at Nadine.</p>
            <p>&quot;She's  not the problem, Matt.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;You  can say that again,&quot; Nadine snapped in their direction. &quot;Did it ever  occur to you what you may be doing? Interfering, making a mess of everything?  Impulsive, like your father.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;You  stole my father from me!&quot; Matt yelled. &quot;Trapped him. And I'm the bad  guy here?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Be  quiet,&quot; said Sarah, eyeing the probing Albertosaurus. &quot;Shouldn't we  talk about this somewhere else?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Nadine  may be right,&quot; said Matt's dad.</p>
            <p>Matt  faced him, wide-eyed and gaping. <em>Nadine  may be right</em>, he mouthed.</p>
            <p>&quot;But  Sarah's also right,&quot; he continued. &quot;This is neither the time nor the  place. We have to elude this predator, and perhaps we can finally go home and  sort this out.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;I'm  all for that,&quot; said Matt.</p>
            <p>Suddenly  the Albertosaurus swung back in their direction. His head came down and his  jaws snapped centimetres from Sarah's torso.</p>
            <p>&quot;Matt,&quot;  she screamed and dove to the side, rolling into the dino droppings herself. At  that moment, she felt the familiar tug on her body. The failsafe was  activating, beginning to draw them home.</p>
            <p>&quot;Time  to go,&quot; said Matt, echoing Sarah's thoughts. &quot;Hang in there, Sarah.  It's going to work this time.&quot; His fists tightened on Dr. Barnes's toga.</p>
            <p>They were  surrounded by a gush of air, pulling them away from the jungle floor. But at  the same time Nadine caterwauled like an injured cat and scooted between the dinosaur's  feet. &quot;Not without me,&quot; she shrieked, leaping at Matt and his father  and landing on top of Dr. Barnes, wrenching him from Matt's grasp. The air  twirled around them and Sarah felt her body compressed into what seemed like  atom size and rebounding on the floor of the lab. Matt plopped down beside her, <em>without</em> his father.</p>
            <p>&quot;No,  no, no!&quot; he cried, pounding his fists on the now-slimy floor. &quot;I had  him. I had him in my hands. We were nearly home. That miserable soul-crushing  demon!&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Oh,  Matt. I'm sorry. This is all so hopeless.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;No,  it's not,&quot; he said, leaping up from the ground. &quot;I'll just set  it up again and we'll go back.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Not <em>th-there</em>?&quot; she said, unable to  disguise the shiver in her voice. &quot;Not in Albertosaurus territory.&quot;  She stood and the excrement oozed down her body, pooling on the floor around  her. She must be a sight, but she hardly cared about that. It was the thought  of those giant jaws nearly crunching down on her spine. She couldn't go back.</p>
            <p>&quot;Isabelle?&quot;  Matt asked the computer. &quot;Is . . . is my father still alive?&quot; His  voice shivered too, so he must also be thinking about the dinosaur.</p>
            <p>&quot;Your  father still exists,&quot; the computer replied.</p>
            <p>&quot;Is  he still in the Cretaceous Period?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Your  father has moved on in time and universe. <em>Son</em>,&quot; she said as an  afterthought. &quot;He is in 701 BCE, in Nubia.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Nubia?&quot;  said Matt. &quot;Where's Nubia?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;The  Nile River,&quot; said Sarah. &quot;Sudan today.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Well  then, we'll just have to go there.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Matt,  I'm not going.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Come  on, Sarah. You can't bail on me now. We were so close this time.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;We're  always so close,&quot; she said. Close enough to see Matt's father, touch him.  Close enough to speak to him, but also close enough to nearly get killed. &quot;We  have to come up with a plan that doesn't involve rapids, arrows, guns, or  dinosaurs. Understand?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;But  . . .&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;No  skunks, bears, pigs, or chickens, <em>comprends</em>?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;They  weren't <em>that</em> dangerous.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Look  at me, Matt.&quot;</p>
            <p>He did  finally look at her, up and down, from sopping head to slimy legs, leaking a  syrupy brown substance on the tiles, and his expression did change. Instead of  the tense, focused look he always wore when he embarked on his &quot;missions,&quot;  his face slackened, his eyebrows rose, and his lips curved. He burst into a  bellowing laugh.</p>
            <p>Sarah  narrowed her eyes and nearly kicked him. She held out at the last minute when he  seized her hand and leaned his clean forehead against her dirty one. &quot;I  always take too many risks with you,&quot; he said. &quot;But you always seem  to come out like this&mdash;alive, healthy, but a little bit stinky.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Oh,  you rat!&quot; She wrenched her hand from his and turned away, hiding the grin  she couldn't suppress. At least, on that point, he was right. &quot;But I'm  still not going.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;We'll  do some research first.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Lots  of research.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;And  we'll get cleaned up too.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Why,  thank you.&quot; She smirked. &quot;And maybe we should stock up on food. We  might have trouble finding it in the desert.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Desert?  I thought you said Nubia was on the Nile River.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Yes,  I did. Don't you know anything? The desert's all around it. You really do need  to do some research. Imagine if we just jumped back in there and we wound up  without any food or water in the middle of the Sahara.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Right,&quot;  said Matt. &quot;So let's go home and do the research, before your dad finds  out we were here.&quot;</p>
            <p>He  grabbed her hand again and this time she didn't extract it. She was having some  trouble getting used to the change in their relationship, but she kind of liked  it. Dad, however, didn't, and he was looking for an alternate place for Matt to  live. He wasn't having much luck so far, though. Matt had no relatives to speak  of.</p>
            <p>They  exited the lab and headed down the long corridor to the sliding doors at the  back of the building. Just as they reached the doors a huge rumble sounded from  deep within the structure's core. The floor shook under their feet and seemed  to ripple. Sarah had to lean against Matt to keep from falling. Gradually the  ripples faded away, but now the air was clouded with dust, even though no  plaster, paint, or drywall had detached from the walls. Sarah and Matt coughed  and hacked for another minute before they could even talk.</p>
            <p>&quot;What  was that?&quot; Sarah asked, still wheezing.</p>
            <p>&quot;Heck  if I know,&quot; said Matt. &quot;Minor earthquake, maybe.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Seemed  like a major one.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Well,  the building's still standing. Could have been a bomb too.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Bite  your tongue.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;It's  possible. We are near Parliament Hill.&quot;</p>
            <p>Sarah  clenched Matt's hand as the door slid open in front of them. She reached out to  keep her balance, but something extraordinary happened as her hand connected  with open air. Flakes seemed to peel from her skin, molecules lifted away. Her  hand was disintegrating before her eyes.</p>
            <p>&quot;What!&quot;  she shrieked and snatched back her hand. It reassembled within the security of  the building.</p>
            <p>Matt  stared at her, stunned. Then he attempted to do the same thing, extending his  hand out into the alleyway behind the building.</p>
            <p>&quot;Matt,  don't!&quot; Sarah exclaimed, but he ignored her warning. As soon as his hand  passed through the doorway, it seemed to come apart too.</p>
            <p>&quot;What?  How?&quot; He quickly retracted his hand.</p>
            <p>&quot;This  is insane,&quot; said Sarah, staring at the invisible barrier between the lab  and the outside world. How could they just . . . <em>disintegrate</em> beyond it? She'd always known that no good would come  from their meddling with time, but never had she imagined something this  bizarre, this horrific. They couldn't even step out of the lab.</p>
            <p>&quot;We're  coming undone,&quot; she whispered, suddenly feeling faint.</p>
