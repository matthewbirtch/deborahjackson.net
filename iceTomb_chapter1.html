			<h3><span>Chapter One</span></h3>

			<p>It was balmy in Antarctica the day the

				science team disappeared. The wind had dipped the thermometer from

				a pleasant -20&deg;F to a more refreshing &#8211;35&deg;F, but

				the temperature made no difference to the stalwart beakers of the

				south. It was October 14 in the year 2015&#8212;the same year that

				China became a democratic nation, an 8.0 earthquake struck the

				heart of Los Angeles and the first lunar residents were settling

				on the moon. All these world events meant nothing to the people

				clustered around the radio in the communications center of McMurdo

				Station&#8212;the American science outpost in the southern continent.

				They were intent on the crackling static.</p>

			<p> Cathy Jones, one of the National Science Foundation&#8217;s

				guides to the &#8216;Deep South,&#8217; was hunkered down amidst

				the penguins and the beakers, twisting her fingers around her short

				coils of copper hair and chewing on her lower lip. She was monitoring

				radio communications with the team along with about ten other people

				crammed into the tiny room. One entire wall of the room was filled

				from top to bottom with electronics within silver boxes, black dials

				and knobs projecting from the metal sheaths. The equipment was devoted

				not only to picking up radio signals throughout the continent but

				to patching into satellite communications as well. A bank of computer

				screens flashing for prompts lined a counter below and a mishmash

				of wires was connected to the hazard of equipment. On a desk in front

				of Cathy rested a couple of microphones and headsets. As they sat

				in tense silence, a blast of wind rattled the Chalet building on

				its foundation, but it was the crisp voice on the radio that rattled

				her even more.</p>

			<p>&#8220; Holy cow! Did you get a load of that?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Jimmy?&#8221; Cathy squeaked as the

				impact of his voice hit her. There&#8217;d been silence from his

				end for far too long.</p>

			<p>&#8220; Still here, Cath,&#8221; he responded

				in a rich baritone clip. &#8220;Bet you were worried.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; I&#8217;ll say,&#8221; she breathed.

				The group of men and women around her let out a collective sigh.

				There were five scientists and three senior managers for the NSF

				along with the two communications experts. They&#8217;d been jammed

				in this room ever since Jimmy&#8217;s plane had touched down in the

				Transantarctic Mountains about four hundred miles south-east of McMurdo

				Station. The last ten minutes, much to the chagrin of the white-knuckled

				lip-chewing group, his signal had been lost.</p>

			<p>Gottlieb, the Antarctic Sciences Section Head,

				nodded vigorously, his silver-streaked hair flipping into his eyes.</p>

			<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not about to lose you, Albright,&#8221; he

				intoned. &#8220;It&#8217;s enough that our geologists from the Beardmore

				Camp have gone missing.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; We&#8217;re all still here, Arnold.

				Although Jeanna and Tom look a little pale.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Cathy blinked. It would make sense that Tom

				Debow, the slight astrophysicist with the slicked-back hair and nervous

				tic to his left eye, would be a little chalked from a hardy expedition,

				or rescue mission&#8212;however they were going to coin this in the

				history books. But Jeanna Sawyer was a glaciologist. They didn&#8217;t

				come more weathered or tough than she did. Despite the body of a

				beanpole, and a sweet, apple-cheeked face, she could set you straight

				in a minute if you thought she was a pushover with a left hook that

				had even laid Sal on his butt more than once. Jimmy hadn&#8217;t

				even mentioned Sal. Of course Sal Vitrioni, the helicopter pilot,

				wasn&#8217;t worth mentioning. He was ex-Navy, bulky with muscle

				and his eyes were hard enough to turn you to stone&#8212;a bloody

				earthquake wouldn&#8217;t shake him up.</p>

			<p>&#8220; W&#8230;what&#8217;s the problem?&#8221; Cathy

				sputtered out, grinding her fingernails into her palms.</p>

			<p>There was a pause after the slight chirp of

				the radio. &#8220;It seems we&#8217;ve found some bodies,&#8221; Jimmy

				finally said.</p>

			<p>Andy and Jamal gasped behind her. &#8220;Dave?

				Mike?&#8221; She could hear their hearts in their throats as they

				choked on the names of their fellow geologists.</p>

			<p>&#8220; No, guys. Not ours. But they&#8217;re

				definitely dead.&#8221;</p>

			<p>A chill ran through Cathy&#8217;s body, as

				much from Jimmy&#8217;s tone as

				his words. There was an edge to his voice that told her the tall, cool volcanologist

				had somehow lost his metal. He was spooked.</p>

			<p>&#8220; It&#8217;s like the killing fields here,&#8221; cried

				Jeanna. &#8220;Only in ice.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Let me get this straight, Jim,&#8221; said

				Gottlieb. &#8220;Are we talking volcano?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; No, Arnold. This isn&#8217;t Vesuvius.

				These people froze to death, rather abruptly. I&#8217;d say they&#8217;ve

				been here for a while.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Cathy frowned and squeezed her broad shoulders

				through the mesh of bodies to get even closer to the radio. It was

				hard to imagine confronting all those corpses in the ice, but at

				least they weren&#8217;t their friends and colleagues. &#8216;A long

				time&#8217; meant there was still hope.</p>

			<p>&#8220; How long do you suppose?&#8221; asked

				Gottlieb.</p>

			<p>&#8220; Hard to say, since they&#8217;re frozen.

				They&#8217;re sort of deep in the ice though. Could be a few hundred

				years.&#8221;</p>

			<p>This time everyone frowned. &#8220;Um, I thought

				this continent was uninhabited until the last fifty years,&#8221; said

				Jamal, shaking the dreadlocks on his head.</p>

			<p>&#8220; Well, everyone thought that Christopher

				Columbus was the first European to reach the New World,&#8221; said

				Jimmy with a slight lilt to his voice. &#8220;When it was actually

				the Vikings that beat him by about four hundred years.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; So you&#8217;re saying these are bloody

				Vikings?&#8221; snorted Andy through his bristly mustache.</p>

			<p>Jimmy chortled, although a little nervously. &#8220;You&#8217;re

				a piece of work, Andy. Think for a minute. You&#8217;re all scientists&#8212;except

				for a few bureaucrats and that wicked beauty nestled in between you.&#8221; Cathy

				felt her face grow warm. Gottlieb and his entourage scowled, although

				the NSF manager had a quirk to his lips.</p>

			<p>&#8220; We&#8217;ve learned through extensive

				study that everything we know, or believe we know, is relative. Einstein

				taught us that. From our position, it looked like we were the first,

				given our own little slice of history. But we should never be so

				arrogant as to believe that we are like Christopher Columbus, that

				we&#8217;re one step ahead of the other guy. Usually we find out,

				to our extreme embarrassment, that we&#8217;re one step behind.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Is this a philosophy lesson, or a science

				expedition?&#8221; asked Gottlieb.</p>

			<p>&#8220; I thought it was a rescue mission,&#8221; said

				Jeanna tremulously. </p>

			<p>&#8220;But there&#8217;s nothing left to rescue

				here.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Cathy grimaced. It was hard enough to hear Jimmy

				a little off the mark, but Jeanna&#8230; It was unnerving.</p>

			<p>&#8220; So you turn around and come back,&#8221; said

				Gottlieb.</p>

			<p>&#8220; No,&#8221; said Jimmy firmly. &#8220;This

				tunnel leads to something. This is where all that roiling heat is

				coming from. Maybe we can still find Dave, Mike and the others.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Jim,&#8221; Cathy broke in. The way

				she clipped his name from affectionate to imploring made him pause.</p>

			<p>&#8220; It&#8217;ll be okay, Cath.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Dave and Mike disappeared. These people

				are dead. How can you say &#8216;it&#8217;ll be okay?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Because we&#8217;re being cautious,&#8221; said

				Jimmy.</p>

			<p>&#8220; By plunging through an icy graveyard&#8230;&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Cathy,&#8221; said Gottlieb sternly. &#8220;It&#8217;s

				Jim&#8217;s call. He&#8217;s a big boy.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Cathy glared at him, but fell silent. What more

				could she do? They only let her be here out of courtesy to Jim since

				he was McMurdo&#8217;s chief volcanologist. She had no business in

				the communications room unless she was on the other side of the mike,

				guiding an expedition. Which is where she should be, but Jimmy wouldn&#8217;t

				hear of it. He was well aware of the danger. And they were all aware

				of the danger too. That&#8217;s why there were ten people here instead

				of two. When one or two people disappear in Antarctica, it&#8217;s

				a tragedy, but not uncommon. When five or six, it&#8217;s time to

				investigate. When ten&#8230;</p>

			<p>Oh, she couldn&#8217;t go there. Not with Jimmy

				in that hollow tube of ice plunging into perilous ground.</p>

			<p>&#8220; Well, this is interesting,&#8221; Jimmy&#8217;s

				voice crackled over the radio again. &#8220;Seems to be some sort

				of structure. It&#8217;s so deep under the ice you&#8217;d have to

				crack it with dynamite to build anything here. Or maybe melt the

				ice with a thermodynamic event.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Such as a fissure in the earth&#8217;s

				crust?&#8221; Jamal suggested.</p>

			<p>&#8220; Possible. But then you&#8217;d have

				a heck of a lot of water to pump out in order to build something

				this big.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Define &#8216;this big,&#8217;&#8221; said

				Gottlieb, stroking his chin.</p>

			<p>&#8220; About fifty stories.&#8221; The room

				was filled with blinking eyes.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Oh, here. There&#8217;s a nice little

				access tunnel, ten by twenty.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Sounds really damn little,&#8221; rasped

				Andy.</p>

			<p>&#8220; We&#8217;re going up now. Some sort

				of ramp. Now this you&#8217;ve got to see.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Try describing it instead,&#8221; said

				Gottlieb in his calm, placating manner.</p>

			<p>&#8220; We&#8217;ve come to a round, hollow

				metal tube. Like a huge barrel they use to store hazardous material

				in. All that&#8217;s missing is the skull and cross-bones.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Get out of there!&#8221; shouted Cathy

				furiously.</p>

			<p>&#8220; Cath, darling. You have no sense of

				humor. You know how I like to exaggerate.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Sure,&#8221; she snapped. &#8220;Like

				the foaming boils of lava on Mount Erebus. They burned right through

				your suit.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; And I returned, still kicking and driving

				you crazy.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; You&#8217;d darn well better this time

				too.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Are you finished?&#8221; asked Gottlieb

				sternly, raising his eyebrows. It would appear that his patience

				was wearing thin with the lovers&#8217; banter and Cathy&#8217;s

				frazzled nerves. She nodded petulantly.</p>

			<p>&#8220; Tell me about this tube,&#8221; said

				Gottlieb. &#8220;Are you standing in front of it?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; I&#8217;m standing in it, Arnold. It

				has a diameter of about eight feet&#8230;feet&#8230;feet. Oh, look

				at that. It echoes too. You know I&#8217;ve seen something like this

				before. It was&#8230;&#8221;</p>

			<p>His voice cut out as a loud gong sounded over

				the radio. Cathy jumped to her feet. &#8220;Jim?&#8221; A repetitive

				hammering noise crackled in and out through the receiver. &#8220;Jim!&#8221; she

				screamed in abject terror. Then she heard them over the bounding

				noise. Voices. Some high-pitched, some low-toned, one unmistakably

				baritone. Screaming.</p>

			<p>She was tugging at her hair, ready to rip it

				from her head. She wanted to jump through the mike and somehow haul

				him out. Before she could do anything, the gongs stopped, but the

				screaming went on for another minute. &#8220;Jim?&#8221; she said

				faintly, her chest as tight as a drum.</p>

			<p>&#8220; Oh hell!&#8221;</p>

			<p>He was still alive. &#8220;Jim, are you all

				right?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Right as rain. Just had my head pounded

				out. I don&#8217;t know what the heck this is, but it sure is loud.

				I could feel the vibrations right through my body. Ears are still

				throbbing.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Turn around,&#8221; said Cathy. &#8220;Get

				out of there now.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; We&#8217;re all okay,&#8221; he said,

				ignoring her as usual when she tried to talk sense into him. &#8220;This

				thing is amazing. Somebody build a giant MRI machine.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Did you hear me!&#8221; she shouted.</p>

			<p>&#8220; Calm down,&#8221; said Gottlieb severely. &#8220;I

				don&#8217;t want to make you leave.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Cathy bit down on her tongue.</p>

			<p>&#8220; What did you say, Jim?&#8221; he prompted.</p>

			<p>&#8220; You know, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance

				Imaging. Uses sound waves to check out the atoms in your body. How

				does it work again, Tom?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Oh,&#8221; said Tom a little vaguely. &#8220;Yes,

				well, atoms tend to spin slightly off the vertical axis. What the

				MRI does is use a giant magnet to make the protons from the nucleuses

				in the atoms line up at the same time as radio waves pulse energy

				through the scanner. The protons absorb the energy required to make

				them spin in a different direction.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Like stopping and spinning a top in

				the opposite direction,&#8221; said Jimmy helpfully.</p>

			<p>&#8220; Right,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;Are you

				going to let me do this?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Sorry,&#8221; said Jimmy sheepishly. &#8220;Go

				on.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Anyway, by turning the magnets on and

				off very rapidly, they can take slices of the human body down to

				the atoms by altering their spin when they&#8217;re on, then, when

				they&#8217;re turned off, the atoms release the excess energy they

				absorbed from the radio waves, giving us an image.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; I was in one once,&#8221; interrupted

				Jim. &#8220;Checking out my liver for a tumor. That was when I was

				on the sauce after my wife died. Bad time.&#8221; He chuckled mirthlessly.</p>

			<p>No one else did.</p>

			<p>&#8220; It was like this, only smaller. Drum

				rolls of sound. Very claustrophobic. Very loud. I wonder who&#8217;s

				looking for tumors here.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Jim, I think you&#8230; should turn

				back,&#8221; said Gottlieb slowly.</p>

			<p>&#8220; Are you kidding?&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;This

				is better than a volcano. Somebody built a giant lab down here. And

				I&#8217;m going to find out what for.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Dammit, Jimmy&#8230;&#8221; Cathy tried

				to blink away the tears, but they crept out anyway.</p>

			<p>&#8220; But I&#8217;ll send Jeanna, Tom and

				Sal back to the helo.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Not on your life,&#8221; growled Sal.

				He&#8217;d been unusually silent up until this point, but his military

				background came into play now. He&#8217;d stayed down in Antarctica

				because he craved this kind of death-defying experience, the more

				extreme the better. &#8220;I never leave a man behind.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; I don&#8217;t want to go either,&#8221; said

				Jeanna in a stronger voice than Cathy had heard earlier. This was

				the Jeanna she knew.</p>

			<p>&#8220;This place is so strange and miraculous,

				like science on steroids. I want to find out who made it.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; I&#8217;m staying too,&#8221; said Tom,

				surprising everyone. &#8220;There&#8217;s something almost celestial

				about this place.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Are you feeling the neutrinos?&#8221; grunted

				Andy.</p>

			<p>&#8220; Maybe,&#8221; said Tom.</p>

			<p>Andy shrugged and rolled his eyes. &#8220;Nutcase,&#8221; he

				whispered.</p>

			<p>&#8220; You have to be, to be a physicist,&#8221; said

				Jamal. &#8220;A lot of genius and a little bit of insanity. That

				way you can swing your mind around anything.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Are you insulting me?&#8221; said Tom

				in his high-pitched whiny voice.</p>

			<p>&#8220; Never,&#8221; said Jamal. &#8220;You

				the man, Tom.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; And don&#8217;t you forget it, rock-splitter.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Hey,&#8221; said Jamal.</p>

			<p>&#8220; Well, if you&#8217;re all in agreement,&#8221; said

				Gottlieb, &#8220;you have my permission to go forward.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Thanks for the go ahead,&#8221; Jimmy

				said snidely.<br />

				Everyone in the tiny room laughed, except Cathy. They all knew that, despite

				Gottlieb&#8217;s title as the head of the National Science Foundation in Antarctica,

				his authority meant nothing to these bull-headed scientists. Cathy clenched

				her sweaty palms together, infuriated and frustrated by their cool disregard

				for danger.</p>

			<p>There was near-total silence now over the radio&#8212;nothing

				but the clip-clop of their boots on the metal tunnel. Finally Jimmy

				broke through again with a gasp.</p>

			<p>&#8220; What is it, Jim?&#8221; asked Gottlieb.</p>

			<p>&#8220; We have a chamber, maybe fourteen feet

				high. Red granite blocks on top. Small tunnels running out the sides

				at oblique angles. There&#8217;s a layer of dust on the floor. No

				exit. Looks like a dead end.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Smells funny in here,&#8221; said Jeanna.</p>

			<p>&#8220; Ya, &#8220; said Sal. &#8220;Something

				like a burnt Christmas dinner.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Burnt a few turkeys in your day, have

				you Sal?&#8221; asked Andy, winking at the others.</p>

			<p>&#8220; More than a few&#8230;&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; I don&#8217;t see anything funny about

				this,&#8221; said Cathy furiously. &#8220;You&#8217;ve reached a

				dead end. There are no people except dead ones outside. It smells

				like burnt flesh.

				DOES THAT TELL YOU ANYTHING!&#8221; she screamed.</p>

			<p>&#8220; Cathy!&#8221; Gottlieb swung around,

				his teeth grinding into each other.</p>

			<p>&#8220; Maybe you&#8217;re right, love,&#8221; said

				Jimmy quietly. &#8220;This does look like ash. Let&#8217;s get the

				hell out of here.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; What&#8217;s that!&#8221; yelled Jeanna,

				her calm voice pitched to a soprano shriek.</p>

			<p>&#8220; There&#8217;s a door rolling shut. Run,

				dammit, run.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Cathy&#8217;s fingers bit into Andy&#8217;s shoulder

				beside her. He didn&#8217;t

				even flinch. His usually comical face was ashen.</p>

			<p>&#8220; Oh God, we&#8217;re trapped!&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; What&#8217;s that!&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Light of some sort.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220; Fire,&#8221; said Jimmy in an oddly

				monotone voice. &#8220;Love you, Cath.&#8221;</p>

			<p>There were ear-splitting shrieks followed by

				a deafening roar, then silence. Cathy felt her knees buckle and the

				world blacken around her.</p>
