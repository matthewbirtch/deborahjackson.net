		    </h1>
		    <p>I've always been fascinated with ancient Egypt. While  immersing myself in tales and historical facts, I came across an equally  fascinating cultural group: the Nubians. Residing in the southernmost portion  of Egypt and in the current region of Sudan, the Nubians have a long and  troubled history, most of which they spent thwarting attacks or resisting  occupation. Invaders were interested in their vast wealth of gold mines&mdash;more  than a hundred scattered over the eastern desert&mdash;ebony, ivory, frankincense,  and decorative items such as ostrich feathers. On several occasions the  invaders left behind imprints of their own culture: Egyptian, Roman, Christian,  Arab, but the Nubians still maintained aspects of their unique civilization.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>During the Middle Kingdom rule of Egypt, Lower Nubia was  annexed, the Egyptian border extended to the Second Cataract where forts were  constructed to protect their trade. One of these forts, Buhen, plays an  important role in <em><a href="timeMeddlersonthenile.html">Time Meddlers on the Nile</a></em>. Buhen had&nbsp;ramparts,  battlements, loopholes, catapult stations and a moat, to name but a few. The  site, upon first glimpse, would make one think of a Medieval fortress, although  it was built between 1878 and 1843 BCE.This fortress was located not far from Abu Simbel, the temple  Ramses the Great carved out of the bedrock in Upper Egypt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p><img src="Images/Buhen, HoremWeb.jpg" alt="Fortress of Buhen" width="498" height="329" /> </p>
          <p>Egypt eventually conquered Nubia in the Middle Kingdom time  period as far as the Fourth Cataract. (A cataract is a series of rapids  produced by jagged volcanic rocks in the Nile River.) But what was of real  interest to me was the <strong>Late Period</strong>&mdash;the <strong>24th to the 30th dynasties</strong>&mdash;a time  when <strong>Nubia ruled over Egypt</strong>.</p>
          <p><br />
            <strong>Kings of the Nubian  Period</strong></p>
			  <p><br />
		      <a href="http://wysinger.homestead.com/piankhy.html">Piankhy</a>'s reign  began in 736 BCE. On a Victory Stele, he proclaimed the conquest of Upper and  Middle Egypt, mainly because the princes of Egypt were quarrelling amongst  themselves and put the kingdom in jeopardy. The next king to take the throne was <a href="http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/shabaka.htm">Shabaqo</a>, a regent who conquered Lower Egypt  in 715 BCE.</p>
		    <p><br />
		      The prince who plays a pivotal role in <em><a href="timeMeddlersonthenile.html">Time Meddlers on the Nile</a></em> is<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/massive-statue-of-pharaoh-taharqa-discovered-deep-in-sudan-1862007.html">Taharqa</a>.  During this time period, 701 BCE, he is summoned to Jerusalem to assist <strong>King Hezekiah</strong> in repelling the <strong>Assyrians</strong> and preventing the city's  capture. More information about this aspect of the plot is explained in the <strong><a href="timeMeddlersonthenilehistoricalnote.html">Historical Note</a></strong>. Taharqa became king in  690 BCE, but eventually met defeat at the hands of the Assyrians later in his  rule. A series of other Nubian kings ascended the throne and faced conquerors, the  defeat and recapture of Egypt, but the Nubian kingdom prevailed long after <a href="http://www.historyofmacedonia.org/AncientMacedonia/AlexandertheGreat.html">Alexander the Great</a> marched into Egypt  and began occupation.</p>
			  <p><img src="Images/Taharqa from Louvre Museum.jpg" width="446" height="600" /></p>
		    <p>A new period in Nubian history began in 653 BCE: the <a href="http://www.jebelbarkal.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=80&Itemid=73">Napatan Dynasty</a>. Several kings ruled  during this time period, including Aspelta, mentioned in the novel. Aspelta was  a king who had issues with the priests of Amun, particularly when they killed  an innocent man. The Temple of Amun was located across the river from Napata,  and archaeologists speculate that might be because the pharaohs and rulers of  Nubia did not always respect or abide by the dictates of the priests.</p>
			  <p>The final period of Nubian rule began in 400 BCE, called the <a href="http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/nubia/meroitic.html">Meroitic kingdom</a>. Mero&euml; was constructed  near the level of the sixth cataract and several ruins of pyramids and temples  still exist today in that location.</p>

              <p><strong>Ta Seti&mdash;Land of the  Bow</strong></p>
            <p><br />
              The Nubians were renowned for their prowess with the bow and  arrow. Often bows were constructed from the stem of a palm branch or wood and horn,  glued together, and sinew. In <em><a href="timeMeddlersonthenile.html">Time  Meddlers on the Nile</a></em>, Matt learns how to this is done.</p>
            <p><em>&quot;The prince had  insisted that Matt construct his own bow and arrows&mdash;a rather interesting  project. Taharqa, himself, used a composite bow, made of several pieces of wood  and horn glued together, but they had no time for such a complicated  construction for Matt. Instead they hacked off a single piece of wood from the stem  of a palm branch and made string from sinew&mdash;as Matt had suspected. They used reeds for their arrows, tipped with barbed iron on occasion, but when that  wasn't available, as was the case at this time, they used sharpened  stones.&quot;</em></p>
                <p><img src="Images/Nubianbowmen.jpg" width="524" height="430" /><br />
            </p>
                <p><strong>The Region of Nubia</strong></p>
                <p><br />
            Nubia was  divided into two regions along the Nile River&mdash;<strong>Upper and Lower Nubia</strong>. Lower Nubia was to the north, like Lower  Egypt, and encompassed the land between the First and Second Cataract. Upper  Nubia&nbsp; was everything beyond the Second  Cataract. This division was much like that of Egypt and Sudan today. Nubia was  characterized by rock formations and desert, along with more fertile areas to  the south swept with vast savannah fields and typical African wildlife: lions,  elephants, zebra etc.</p>
                <p><strong>Cataracts</strong> are what define this section of the river&mdash;a  succession of swift rapids tumbling over volcanic rock, hemmed in by cliff  formations that created canyons. Often they marked the transition of one area  of bedrock to another. They were important in ancient Nubia, because they had  the ability to impede or prevent navigation on the river.</p>
                <p>Geology  holds the key to Nubia's diverse regions, just as it reveals transition zones.  The first three formations are: <strong>limestone</strong>, <strong>sandstone</strong>, and a &quot;basement  complex&quot; composed&nbsp; primarily of <strong>granite</strong>. The principal bedrock of the  great valley of Egypt is limestone, a plateau drifted over with sand. A few  miles north of Aswan, coarse, yellow Nubian sandstone takes over, covering a  large area of the Sahara up to the conjunction of the two Niles (Blue and  White) and into Libya. Underneath the sandstone is much harder granite.</p>
                <p>From  Khartoum to Aswan, the Nile flows over alternating zones of granite and  sandstone, where the cataracts emerge. The granite is hard and resistant to  erosion, generally leaving behind sharp ridges and spikes, separated by narrow,  deep <em>wadis</em> (dry channels or canyons).  The riverbed is narrow, steep-walled, broken by islands and cataracts (as  described in <em>Time Meddlers on the Nile</em>,  when Matt and Sarah take the plunge). The land in the granite area usually has  very little fertile soil.</p>
                <p>Sandstone,  by contrast, is soft and runs horizontally, making level terraces and  occasionally flat-topped remnants of higher formations, with some broad,  shallow <em>wadis</em>. In these zones, there  is often an alluvial floodplain, along one or both banks, as revealed in the  description of Napata in <em><a href="timeMeddlersonthenile.html">Time Meddlers on  the Nile</a></em>:</p>
                <p><em>The city rose from the  floodplain, surrounded by emerald and golden fields and orchards, a colourful  contrast to the sandy background of the desert. At first tiny circular mudbrick  houses with flat roofs dotted the pathway. Then they rode past larger and  larger walled estates constructed of pink stone. Matt spotted an even more  impressive building, with glyph-covered stone columns and a wooden gateway at  the end of a road of flagstones. Across the river an odd mountain rose, with  sheer sides and a flat top like a butte in the North American West.</em></p>
            <p>As you may have determined by some of my books, I've always been  fascinated with geology, so this region that was governed by its geology was  particularly inspiring. I am also fascinated with&nbsp; diverse cultures, archaeology, and ancient  and more recent battles. I could continue to ramble on and on, but that is not  my purpose here. I've merely attempted to whet your appetite for all things  Nubian.</p>
<p>If you're interested in further information about the  Nubians, I suggest you read <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nubian-Pharaohs-Black-Kings-Nile/dp/977416010X">The Nubian Pharaohs, Black Kings on the  Nile</a>&nbsp; </em>by Charles Bonnet and Dominique  Valbelle, or dig up an even more ancient book that explores the archaeology in  great detail, but may be too technical for younger readers:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nubia-Corridor-William-Y-Adams/dp/0691093709/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1313765254&sr=1-1"><em>Nubia, Corridor to Africa</em></a> by William Y.  Adams. Some less technical references can be found in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Daily-Nubians-Greenwood-Through-History/dp/0313325014/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1313765340&sr=1-1"><em>Daily Life of the Nubians</em></a> by Robert Steven Bianchi and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ancient-Egyptians-Their-Neighbors-Activity/dp/1556523602/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1313765399&sr=1-1"><em>Ancient Egyptians and their Neighbors</em></a> by  Marian Broida.
