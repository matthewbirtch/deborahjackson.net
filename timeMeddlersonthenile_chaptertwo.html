	        <strong>Time Disruption</strong></p>
            <p>Matt stood at the entrance to the  lab building, trying to comprehend. If he thrust even the tip of his finger  through the partition, it seemed to disassemble. Beyond the door all he could  see was uninterrupted forest&mdash;not a building in sight. What had happened? Had  time been altered in such a way that North American civilization didn&rsquo;t exist  anymore, that <em>they</em> didn&rsquo;t exist? No,  it couldn&rsquo;t be. But why couldn&rsquo;t they leave the lab building?</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;Matt, do you have any idea . . . ?&rdquo;  Sarah&rsquo;s voice seemed small and lost. Why shouldn&rsquo;t it be? This was impossible,  wasn&rsquo;t it?</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Something to do with  the time machine, I think.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;It would have to be. No earthquake  or bomb could do this. This building, we&rsquo;d be wiped out too, and there&rsquo;s  nothing left out there.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;Not a building. Not a house,&rdquo; Matt  agreed.</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;Dad? Matt, what do you think  happened to Dad?&rdquo; She wobbled, weakly, as if she might faint.</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be okay, Sarah. We&rsquo;ll work  it out.&rdquo; He tried to sound reassuring. &ldquo;First we&rsquo;ll go back to the lab. We can&rsquo;t  seem to go anywhere else, and Isabelle might have some answers.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              They shuffled back down the  corridor, still examining their arms. Matt couldn&rsquo;t figure out why, if they  came apart outside, they remained bonded in the building. The lab door popped  open at his command and they entered, wondering if the entire lab had been changed  too. It hadn&rsquo;t, but the portal, which Matt had closed, was open again, only it  seemed hazy.</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;Isabelle,&rdquo; said Matt. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go  outside the lab building. We sort of, <em>poof</em>,  disintegrate. Do you know what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;Time alteration,&rdquo; said the  computer. &ldquo;Timeline discontinued.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;What? Which timeline?&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;The current one in this universe.  Unfortunately, you can no longer be my son,&rdquo; said Isabelle, &ldquo;because you cannot  exist, because Dr. Barnes cannot exist, and therefore, I cannot exist.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              A tremor jittered through Matt&rsquo;s  body. What did she mean, his father couldn&rsquo;t exist? Had his dad died? But even  if that had happened, it must have occurred after he&rsquo;d created the time  machine, and Matt. It shouldn&rsquo;t have changed the timeline and now be  threatening to erase them.</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;But you do exist,&rdquo; said Matt. &ldquo;And  my father, is he dead?&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;Your father has altered time. He  still exists in the past, but when he is pulled back into the wormhole between  the universes he will cease.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              &nbsp;The tremor expanded until he was shaking all over.  Sarah placed her hand on his shoulder.</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;Do you mean,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;that he  did something in the past to make it so he wouldn&rsquo;t be born?&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;Yes, essentially,&rdquo; said Isabelle. &ldquo;In  this timeline. The alteration was too disruptive to the original events of history.  Once the wormhole envelops him again he will cease to exist and then I will  cease as well. Once I no longer exist, you will be no more. All memory of this  will be gone.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Matt, shaking his head. &ldquo;My  father wouldn&rsquo;t . . . How could he change . . . ? What did he do?&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;Your father was in Nubia. I do not  know what he did, but it altered history irrevocably.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be. How could anything he  did have changed history so completely that . . . What&rsquo;s changed, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;I do not know. Everything is on  the verge of disappearing, including me. All I am certain of is what surrounds  us. Forest. No structures, no Ottawa, likely no western civilization in North  America, if that is the case.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              Matt grasped the chair in front of  him to keep his balance. He held his breath for a few seconds, trying to absorb  what the computer was saying. &ldquo;My father only changed <em>this</em> universe?&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;Yes. The wormhole brought him to  this one.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              Sarah sank to the chair beside the  console. Her warm olive skin looked almost ghostly. &ldquo;What did he do? Is  everything gone? Dad? Mom? Canada? The United States?&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              &nbsp;&ldquo;Isabelle, can you tell us any more about how  this happened?&rdquo; Matt asked.</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;If I could access the new  timeline, assuming another computer existed with which I could make a  connection, I would be able to compare the two, but I can find nothing to  interface with. Also, power has been disrupted and I only have a finite amount remaining  in my backup unit.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;You&rsquo;re losing power?&rdquo; Matt&rsquo;s chest  locked and he could hardly breathe. Now the computer was dying?</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;Yes. You can access my databanks  for the historical records, but I may not have enough power to keep it up for  long, and if you cannot read fast enough, it will be gone&nbsp; before you have the required information to  identify what your father may have altered. Instead I will dump the data and  print it for you as long as I can.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              The printer beside the main console  bleeped into life and began to spew out page after page of data. Matt ran over  and grabbed a fistful, but a minute later he was finding the factual  information on Nubia, Egypt, and the rise of western civilization difficult to  sift through.</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t . . . read this, Sarah,&rdquo;  he said, hardly able to spit out the words.</p>
            <p><br />
              Sarah still seemed shell-shocked,  her eyes wide and dazed. She shuffled over to the printer anyway, and picked up  a handful of notes. She appeared to be reading quickly, but a perplexed frown  creased her face.</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just history. How can we  possibly know what he did to change the past so drastically it erased us?&rdquo; she  said.</p>
            <p><br />
              Matt couldn&rsquo;t believe she didn&rsquo;t  get it. &ldquo;There has to be a link between our civilization and this . . . Nubia.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s like looking for one  small fish in an ocean. It can&rsquo;t be done.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              Matt scowled. This wasn&rsquo;t the Sarah  he was accustomed to. She was always a little timid, but she never gave up. &ldquo;Yes,  it can. We&rsquo;re not going to just disappear. We&rsquo;ll have to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;My backup power is nearly gone,&rdquo;  Isabelle interrupted. &ldquo;If you wish to stop Dr. Barnes, you must leave soon. Once my power is drained, the portal will  not function.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;Leave?&rdquo; said  Sarah.</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo;  said Matt. &ldquo;We have to go to Nubia to stop him.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t  read the information. We don&rsquo;t know what he did, or where in Nubia he is.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              Matt stared at  her for a long minute, then he came up with a plan. Well, it wasn&rsquo;t much of a  plan, but it was all he could think of. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take the data with us,&rdquo; he said,  grasping his backpack from the floor where he&rsquo;d chucked it when they&rsquo;d traveled  to the Cretaceous period. &ldquo;Isabelle, can you at least  tell us when Dad changed history?&rdquo;</p>
            <p> <br />
              &ldquo;Yes, it was in 701 BCE.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;All right. At least we know that  much. Then you&rsquo;ll have to send us there to that time,&rdquo; said Matt.</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;Earlier,&rdquo; said Sarah, surprising  Matt with her sudden agreement. A determined look was smoothing out her brow. &ldquo;Isabelle,&rdquo;  said Sarah. &ldquo;Can you tell us where Dr. Barnes entered Nubia?&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;Dr. Barnes first arrived in Nubia  near the Sixth Cataract of the Nile River.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;Well then, that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re  heading,&rdquo; said Matt. &ldquo;Scan us.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              Isabelle scanned them both, Matt in  his ball cap, Sarah in her wide-brimmed zebra-striped Safari thing. If the  situation weren&rsquo;t so tense, he would have made a comment.</p>
            <p><br />
              The scanning complete, they tossed  the hats on the ground.</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;You must hurry,&rdquo; said Isabelle. &ldquo;I  am diverting power from lights and heating.&rdquo; The lights flickered above them, and  then were extinguished.</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;Great,&rdquo; said Matt. &ldquo;Open the  portal near the Sixth Cataract just before my dad got there.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              The bubble in the portal altered  slightly, distortions running through it like heat waves, but the hazy  atmosphere remained. They couldn&rsquo;t see anything.</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;Okay. Let&rsquo;s do it,&rdquo; said Matt, grabbing  Sarah&rsquo;s hand and drawing her toward the bubble.</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;Matt, we&rsquo;re not dressed for  ancient Nubia. How do you think people are going to react to us? We might do as  much damage as your dad.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><br />
              &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t make things any worse,&rdquo;  said Matt. He stepped into the portal, squaring his shoulders, determined to  stop the destruction of his world.</p>
            <p> Then something occurred to him. &ldquo;By the way,  Isabelle, what&rsquo;s a cataract?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>The earth dropped	out	from under his feet.</p>
