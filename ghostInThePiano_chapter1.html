		<h2>Ghost in the Piano</h2>

		<h3>Chapter One</h3>

		<h4>Music at Midnight</h4>

		<p>It began on a cold night in May &#8211; exactly

			a month after I&#8217;d stopped playing the piano. I went downstairs

			for a glass of water around midnight. It was so quiet in the house;

			the only sound was the buzz of my Dad&#8217;s snores. I tiptoed to

			the kitchen, grasped the handle of the fridge and stopped.</p>

		<p>There was a single clang - one jarring chord

			that rang crisp through the bottom level of the house and vibrated

			in my head. I caught my breath and waited, my knuckles turning white

			as I clenched the handle. Nothing else. I slowly let out some air

			and released my grip on the fridge. Something must have fallen on

			the piano. A book my mother had left on top, teetering boldly on

			the edge. It had finally lost its balance; that was all.</p>

		<p>I crept over the icy floor tiles in my bare

			feet. I shivered, but didn&#8217;t stop. After all, it must have

			been only gravity that had caused the piano to sound off. Into the

			living room, across the hardwood strips &#8211; that seemed even

			colder, although that wasn&#8217;t possible &#8211; right up to the

			ribbed keys. There wasn&#8217;t a book in sight. Only a wispy cloud

			above the keyboard, as if someone had blown the dust off the keys.</p>

		<p>I stared at the old piano for a long time, but

			the dust finally settled and there was no more sound. Even my Dad&#8217;s

			snores seemed muffled down here. So I turned away and headed for

			the staircase. As my toes touched the bottom step, it clanged again,

			only it didn&#8217;t stop at one angry chord, but leapt right into

			a string of tearful notes. It was sound that would have had me sobbing

			if I weren&#8217;t so terrified. I sprang back and leapt through

			the archway of the living room, stopping just short of the piano

			that was cleverly playing by itself. I blinked and blinked, the sound

			sweeping through me, but at the same time making my knees knock.

			I looked left and right. I looked under the bench to see if someone

			was pulling strings and in that way, pulling my leg. Nobody there.

			With trembling fingers, I lifted the top from the upright and stared

			at the vibrating strings inside, untouched by human hands, with no

			attachment to an electronic memory. The piano was alive.</p>

		<p>I sprang back, dropping the lid with a thud.

			The keys continued to play in a slow deliberate march that reminded

			me of the music played at a funeral. This was serious supernatural

			stuff. It had to be a ghost, although I couldn&#8217;t see anything

			other than the keys dancing. I knew I couldn&#8217;t handle this

			by myself. I turned and fled up the stairs, racing into my parents&#8217; bedroom.</p>

		<p>&#8220; Dad! Wake up!&#8221; I shrieked.</p>

		<p>He was instantly awake and wary. &#8220;W&#8230;what?

			Is the house on fire?&#8221;</p>

		<p>I shook my head. &#8220;Listen.&#8221;</p>

		<p>My father cocked his head. There wasn&#8217;t

			a creak, let alone a melody.</p>

		<p>&#8220; Did you hear someone in the house, Jenna?&#8221; he

			asked, still perked, but a little less panicked. He swung his feet

			over the edge of the bed and touched my arm.</p>

		<p>&#8220; Y&#8230;yes,&#8221; I said. It would

			be stupid to tell him I&#8217;d heard a ghost. &#8220;Come downstairs.&#8221;</p>

		<p>He nodded. At first he shook my mother to try

			to rouse her. She was lying on her side, one arm flung over her head,

			her long brown hair draped over her face. &#8220;Claire. Claire!&#8221; he

			shouted in her ear, but she only groaned and rolled over. He shrugged

			and got out of bed. &#8220;I thought it would be better if she knew

			where we were, in case there was trouble. But I think our bandit

			must be long gone if he heard your shouting. You stay behind me.&#8221;</p>

		<p>We crouched down the stairs - Dad with his hefty

			baseball bat - into the gloomy front hall. I sucked in my breath

			as we crept into the living room, but the piano held its tongue,

			looking once again like a lifeless object.</p>

		<p>&#8220; It was here,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Right

			here.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220; What was?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220; A ghost.&#8221; I looked at him with

			clear eyes, trying to show him that I wasn&#8217;t crazy. &#8220;It

			was playing the piano.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Dad met my gaze but his eyes had become flat

			and dull. &#8220;Really? Did you see it?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220; I saw the piano, and I heard it, playing

			by itself.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220; Oh. That&#8217;s interesting. Are you

			sure?&#8221;</p>

		<p>I nodded vigorously. &#8220;I was getting a

			glass of water.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220; You woke up?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220; Yes.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220; And you were half asleep?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220; You don&#8217;t believe me, do you?&#8221; Dad

			was squinting at me just like when I was six and he&#8217;d wondered

			where all the chocolates had gone. I&#8217;d denied it left, right

			and center, through my swollen cheeks. Or when Mom&#8217;s favorite

			ornament had been broken and I had his bat behind my back. &#8220;It

			wasn&#8217;t me,&#8221; never flew with Dad. Maybe that was because

			he was a cop &#8211; the po-lice &#8211; and he didn&#8217;t believe

			anyone&#8217;s story to be the &#8216;honest truth.&#8217; That hadn&#8217;t

			changed, even though everything else had since the shooting. Just

			four months ago Dad had killed a car thief in self defense out on

			old Highway 9, just north of our small town of Prudence, and he&#8217;d

			been acting weird ever since. Nobody could talk to him about it,

			although the whole town was buzzing with gossip. He never brought

			his gun home anymore either, but I suppose it wouldn&#8217;t have

			helped with the piano.</p>

		<p>&#8220; I believe that you heard something,&#8221; he

			said. &#8220;Maybe the whistle of the wind, or a creak of some floorboards,

			but not a ghost.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220; Dad, it was the piano. It was playing

			a song.&#8221;</p>

		<p>He patted my head and said, &#8220;Uh huh.&#8221; Then

			he turned and headed for the staircase. Over his shoulder he threw, &#8220;Maybe

			it was just your guilty conscience.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I gasped. He knew. How did he always know when

			I was doing something wrong, even when I put on my sweetest face

			and lied my little heart out? It was so upsetting I almost forgot

			about the piano. But how could I forget it when it was staring me

			in the face.</p>

		<p>&#8220; You&#8217;re not going to get away with

			it,&#8221; I snarled at the instrument. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to

			get to the bottom of this.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I left it there, staring harmlessly at the opposite

			wall, without a twang of life.</p>
