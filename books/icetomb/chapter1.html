			<h3><span>Chapter One</span></h3>

			<p>It was balmy in Antarctica the day the  science team disappeared. The wind had dipped the thermometer from a pleasant  -20&deg;F to a more refreshing &ndash;35&deg;F, but the temperature made no difference to the  stalwart beakers of the south. It was October 14 in the year 2039 &nbsp;&ndash; the same year that China became a democratic  nation, an 8.0 earthquake struck the heart of Los Angeles and the first lunar  residents were settling on the moon. All these world events meant nothing to  the people clustered around the radio in the communications center of McMurdo  Station, the American science outpost in the southern continent. They were  intent on the crackling static.</p>
			<p>Cathy Jones, one of the National Science  Foundation&rsquo;s guides to the <em>deep south</em>,  was hunkered down amidst the penguins and the beakers, twisting her fingers  around her short coils of copper hair and chewing on her lower lip. She was  monitoring radio communications with the team along with ten other people  crammed into the tiny room. One entire wall of the room was filled from top to  bottom with electronics within silver boxes, black dials and knobs projecting  from the metal sheaths. The equipment was devoted not only to picking up radio  signals throughout the continent but to patching into satellite communications  as well. A bank of computer screens flashing for prompts lined a counter below  and a mishmash of wires was connected to the hazard of equipment. On a desk in  front of Cathy rested a couple of antiquated microphones and headsets. As they  sat in silence, a blast of wind rattled the Chalet building on its foundation,  but it was the crisp voice on the radio that rattled her even more.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Holy cow! Did you get a load of that?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Jimmy?&rdquo; Cathy squeaked as the impact of  his voice hit her, after the long silence from his end.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Still here, Cath,&rdquo; he responded in a rich  baritone clip. &ldquo;Bet you were worried.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say,&rdquo; she breathed. The group of men  and women around her let out a collective sigh. There were five scientists and  three senior managers for the NSF along with the two communications experts.  They&rsquo;d been jammed in this room ever since Jimmy&rsquo;s plane had touched down in the  Transantarctic Mountains, four hundred miles southeast of McMurdo Station. The  last ten minutes, much to the chagrin of the white-knuckled lip-chewing group,  his signal had been lost.</p>
			<p>Gottlieb, the Antarctic Sciences&rsquo; section head,  nodded vigorously, his silver-streaked hair flipping into his eyes. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not  about to lose you, Albright,&rdquo; he intoned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough that our geologists from  the Beardmore Camp have gone missing.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all still here, Arnold. Although  Jeanna and Tom look a little pale.&rdquo;</p>
			<p><em>Really?</em> thought Cathy. It would make sense that Tom Debow, the slight  astrophysicist with the slicked-back hair and nervous tic to his left eye,  would be a little chalked from a hardy expedition, or rescue mission &ndash; however  they were going to coin it in the history books. But Jeanna Sawyer was a glaciologist.  They didn&rsquo;t come any tougher. Despite the body of a beanpole and a sweet,  apple-cheeked face, she&rsquo;d set you straight in a minute, if you thought she was  a pushover, with a left hook that had even laid Sal on his butt more than once.  Jimmy hadn&rsquo;t even mentioned Sal. Of course Sal Vitrioni, the helicopter pilot,  wasn&rsquo;t worth mentioning. He was ex-Navy, heavy with muscle, and his eyes had a  Medusa quality that had made Cathy shiver more than once. A bloody earthquake  wouldn&rsquo;t shake him up.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;W-what&rsquo;s the problem?&rdquo; Cathy sputtered  out, grinding her fingernails into her palms.</p>
			<p>A pause came after the slight chirp of the  radio. &ldquo;It seems we&rsquo;ve found some bodies,&rdquo; Jimmy finally said.</p>
			<p>Andy and Jamal gasped behind her. &ldquo;Dave?  Mike?&rdquo; They choked out the names of their fellow geologists.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;No, guys. Not ours. But they&rsquo;re definitely  d-dead.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>A chill ran through Cathy, as much from  Jimmy&rsquo;s tone as his words. He was usually so . . . steady.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like the killing fields here,&rdquo; cried  Jeanna. &ldquo;Only in ice.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Let me get this straight, Jim,&rdquo; said  Gottlieb. &ldquo;Are we talking volcano?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;No, Arnold. This isn&rsquo;t Vesuvius. These  people froze to death, rather abruptly. I&rsquo;d say they&rsquo;ve been here for a while.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Cathy frowned and squeezed her broad  shoulders through the mesh of bodies to get even closer to the radio. It was  hard to imagine confronting all those corpses in the ice, but at least they  weren&rsquo;t their friends and colleagues. &ldquo;A long time&rdquo; meant there was still hope.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;How long do you suppose?&rdquo; asked Gottlieb.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Hard to say, since they&rsquo;re frozen. They&rsquo;re  sort of deep in the ice, though. Could be a few hundred years.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>This time everyone frowned. &ldquo;Um, I thought  this continent was uninhabited until the last eighty years,&rdquo; said Jamal,  shaking the dreadlocks on his head.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Well, everyone thought that Christopher  Columbus was the first European to reach the New World,&rdquo; said Jimmy with a  slight lilt to his voice, &ldquo;when the Vikings actually beat him by about four  hundred years.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re saying these are bloody  Vikings?&rdquo; snorted Andy through his bristly mustache.</p>
			<p>Jimmy chortled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a piece of work,  Andy. Think for a minute. You&rsquo;re all scientists &ndash; except for a few bureaucrats  and that wicked beauty nestled between you.&rdquo; Cathy&rsquo;s face grew warm. Gottlieb  and his entourage scowled, although the NSF manager had a quirk to his lips.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve learned through extensive study that  everything we know, or believe we know, is relative. Einstein taught us that.  From our position, it looked like we were the first, given our own little slice  of history. But we should never be so arrogant as to believe that we are like  Christopher Columbus, that we&rsquo;re one step ahead of the other guy. Usually we  find out, to our extreme embarrassment, that we&rsquo;re one step behind.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Is this a philosophy lesson or a science  expedition?&rdquo; asked Gottlieb.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I thought it was a rescue mission,&rdquo; said  Jeanna. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s . . . nothing left to rescue here.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Cathy grimaced. It was hard enough to hear  Jimmy a little off the mark, but Jeanna?</p>
			<p>&ldquo;So you turn around and come back,&rdquo; said Gottlieb.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jimmy firmly. &ldquo;This tunnel leads  to something. It&rsquo;s where all the unusual heat is coming from. Maybe we can  still find Dave, Mike, and the others.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; Cathy broke in. The way she clipped  his name from affectionate to imploring made him pause.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be okay, Cath.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Dave and Mike disappeared. These people  are dead. How can you say &lsquo;it&rsquo;ll be okay?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Because we&rsquo;re being cautious,&rdquo; said Jimmy.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;By plunging through an icy graveyard?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Cathy,&rdquo; said Gottlieb. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Jim&rsquo;s call.  He&rsquo;s a big boy.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Cathy glared at him, but fell silent. What  more could she do? They&rsquo;d only allowed her to monitor the situation out of  courtesy to Jim, since he was McMurdo&rsquo;s chief volcanologist. She had no  business in the communications room unless she was on the other side of the  mike, guiding an expedition. Which is where she should be, but Jimmy had vetoed  her attempt. He was well aware of the danger. They were <em>all</em> aware of the danger. That&rsquo;s why there were ten people here  instead of two. When one or two people disappear in Antarctica, it&rsquo;s a tragedy,  but not uncommon. When five or six, it&rsquo;s time to investigate. When ten . . . </p>
			<p>Oh, she couldn&rsquo;t go there. Not with Jimmy  in that hollow tube of ice surrounded by corpses.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Well, this is interesting,&rdquo; Jimmy&rsquo;s voice  crackled over the radio again. &ldquo;Seems to be some sort of structure. It&rsquo;s so  deep under the ice you&rsquo;d have to crack it with dynamite to build anything here.  Or maybe melt the ice with a thermodynamic event.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Such as a fissure in the earth&rsquo;s crust?&rdquo;  Jamal suggested.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Possible. But then you&rsquo;d have a heck of a  lot of water to pump out in order to build something this big.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Define &lsquo;this big,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Gottlieb,  stroking his chin.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;About fifty stories.&rdquo; The room was filled  with blinking eyes. &ldquo;Oh, here. There&rsquo;s a nice little access tunnel, ten by  twenty.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Sounds really damn little,&rdquo; rasped Andy.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going up now. Some sort of ramp. Now  this you&rsquo;ve got to see.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Try describing it instead,&rdquo; said Gottlieb  in his calm, placating manner.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come to a round, hollow metal tube.  Like a huge barrel used to store hazardous material. All that&rsquo;s missing is the  skull and crossbones sign.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Get out of there!&rdquo; shouted Cathy.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Cath, darling. You have no sense of humor.  You know how I like to exaggerate.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;Like when you  mentioned the fireworks of lava on Mount Erebus. They burned right through your  suit.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;And I returned, still kicking and driving  you crazy.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d darn well better this time too.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Are you finished?&rdquo; asked Gottlieb, raising  his eyebrows.</p>
			<p>She nodded, although she couldn&rsquo;t help but  shoot him another glare.</p>
		  <p>&ldquo;Tell me about this tube,&rdquo; said Gottlieb.  &ldquo;Are you standing in front of it?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m standing in it, Arnold. It has a  diameter of about eight feet . . . feet . . . feet. Oh, look at that. It echoes  too. You know I&rsquo;ve seen something like this before. It was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
			<p>His voice cut out as a loud gong sounded  over the radio. Cathy jumped to her feet. &ldquo;Jim?&rdquo; A repetitive hammering noise  crackled in and out through the receiver. &ldquo;Jim!&rdquo; she screamed. Then she heard  them over the bounding noise. Voices. Some high-pitched, some low-toned, one  unmistakably baritone. Screaming.</p>
			<p>She was tugging at her hair, ready to rip  it right out of her head. She wanted to jump through the mike and somehow haul  him out. Before she could do anything, the gongs stopped, but the screaming  continued for another minute. &ldquo;Jim?&rdquo; she said faintly, her chest tight as a  coiled spring.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Oh hell!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>He was still alive. &ldquo;Jim, are you all  right?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Right as rain. Just had my head pounded  out. I don&rsquo;t know what the heck this is, but it sure is loud. I could feel the  vibrations right through my body. Ears are still throbbing.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Turn around,&rdquo; said Cathy. &ldquo;Get out of  there now.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all okay,&rdquo; he said, ignoring her as  usual when she tried to talk sense into him. &ldquo;This thing is amazing. Somebody  build a giant MRI machine.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Did you hear me!&rdquo; she shouted.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Calm down,&rdquo; said Gottlieb severely. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  want to make you leave.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Cathy bit down on her tongue.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;What did you say, Jim?&rdquo; he prompted.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;You know, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance  Imaging. Uses sound waves to check out the atoms in your body. How does it work  again, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Tom a little vaguely. &ldquo;Yes,  well, atoms tend to spin slightly off the vertical axis. What the MRI does is  use a giant magnet to make the protons from the nucleuses in the atoms line up  at the same time as radio waves pulse energy through the scanner. The protons  absorb the energy required to make them spin in a different direction.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Like stopping and spinning a top in the  opposite direction,&rdquo; said Jimmy.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Are you going to let me  do this?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; said Jimmy sheepishly. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Anyway, by turning the magnets on and off  very rapidly, they can take slices of the human body down to the atoms by  altering their spin when they&rsquo;re on, then, when they&rsquo;re turned off, the atoms  release the excess energy they absorbed from the radio waves, giving us an  image.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I was in one once,&rdquo; interrupted Jim.  &ldquo;Checking out my liver for a tumor. That was when I was on the sauce after my  wife died. Bad time.&rdquo; He chuckled mirthlessly.</p>
			<p>No one else did.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It was like this, only smaller. Drum rolls  of sound. Very claustrophobic. Very loud. I wonder who&rsquo;s looking for tumors  here.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Jim, I think you should . . . turn back,&rdquo;  said Gottlieb.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Are you kidding?&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;This is  better than a volcano. Somebody built a giant lab down here. And I&rsquo;m going to  figure out its purpose.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Dammit, Jimmy . . .&rdquo; Cathy tried to blink  away the tears, but they crept out anyway.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll send Jeanna, Tom, and Sal back to  the helo.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Not on your life,&rdquo; growled Sal. He&rsquo;d been  unusually quiet up until this point, but now his military background came into  play. &ldquo;I never leave a man behind.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go either,&rdquo; said Jeanna in  a stronger voice than Cathy had heard earlier. This was the Jeanna she knew.  &ldquo;This place is so strange and miraculous, like science on steroids. I want to  discover who made it.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m staying too,&rdquo; said Tom, surprising  everyone. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something almost celestial about this place.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Are you feeling the neutrinos?&rdquo; grunted  Andy.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
			<p>Andy shrugged and rolled his eyes.  &ldquo;Nutcase,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;You have to be, to be a physicist,&rdquo; said  Jamal. &ldquo;A lot of genius and a little bit of insanity. That way you can swing  your mind around anything.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Are you insulting me?&rdquo; said Tom in his  high-pitched whiny voice.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said Jamal. &ldquo;You the man, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you forget it, rock-splitter.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; said Jamal.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;re all in agreement,&rdquo; said  Gottlieb, &ldquo;you have my permission to go forward.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Thanks for the go ahead,&rdquo; Jimmy said  snidely.</p>
			<p>Everyone in the tiny room laughed, except  Cathy. They all knew that, despite Gottlieb&rsquo;s title as the head of the National  Science Foundation in Antarctica, his authority meant nothing to these  bull-headed scientists. Cathy clenched her sweaty palms. Sometimes, despite  their PhDs and their research papers and their various titles, they were just  idiots.</p>
			<p>On  the radio the voices had petered out and a pall of silence hung over it &ndash;  nothing punctured it but the clip-clop of boots on the metal tunnel. Finally  Jimmy broke through with a gasp.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;What is it, Jim?&rdquo; asked Gottlieb.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We have a chamber, maybe fourteen feet  high. Red granite blocks on top. Small tunnels extending out the sides at  oblique angles. There&rsquo;s a layer of dust on the floor. No exit. Looks like a  dead end.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Smells funny in here,&rdquo; said Jeanna.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Yeah, &ldquo; said Sal. &ldquo;Something like a burnt  Christmas dinner.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Burnt a few turkeys in your day, have you  Sal?&rdquo; asked Andy, winking at the others.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;More than a few&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything funny about this,&rdquo;  said Cathy. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve reached a dead end. There are no people except dead ones  outside. It smells like burnt flesh. Does that tell you anything!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Cathy!&rdquo; Gottlieb swung around, his teeth  grinding together.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re right, love,&rdquo; said Jimmy  quietly. &ldquo;This does look like ash. Let&rsquo;s get the hell out of here.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that!&rdquo; yelled Jeanna, her voice  pitched to a soprano shriek.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a door rolling shut. Run, dammit,  run.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Cathy&rsquo;s fingers bit into Andy&rsquo;s shoulder  beside her. He didn&rsquo;t even flinch. His usually comical face was ashen.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Oh God, we&rsquo;re trapped!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Light of some sort.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Fire,&rdquo; said Jimmy in an oddly monotone  voice. &ldquo;Love you, Cath.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>There were ear-splitting shrieks followed  by a deafening roar, then silence.</p>
