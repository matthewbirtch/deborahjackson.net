					<h3>Editor's Picks</h3>

					<p>&quot;She may be a new kid on the science fiction block, but Ottawa writer Deborah Jackson could well rank up there one day with the likes of Isaac Asimov or Arthur C. Clarke.&quot;</p>

					<p>&quot;Ice Tomb is surprising not just for its entirely believable plot and well-crafted suspense, but because it has all the earmarks of a tale written by a sci-fi master.&quot;</p>

					<p class="byline">&ndash; Mike Gillespie,

						The Ottawa Citizen</p>

				</div>

				<h3 style="margin-top:25px">Top Pick--4 1/2 Stars (Fantastic)</h3>

				<p>&quot;Ice Tomb is set in the near future, 2015, and the science in the fiction is very plausible. A fast-paced story with plenty of twists, this book reads like a classic sci-fi tale. The characters are well drawn, the action plentiful and the outcome surprising.&quot; <a href="http://www.rtbookreviews.com/book-review/ice-tomb">Read more</a><a href="http://www.romantictimes.com/bookpage.php?bookid=25682" target="_blank" class="arrows"></a></p>

				<h3>Five Stars </h3>

				<p>&quot;Jackson's book is a good reason why speculative fiction should shed its stigma of 'fantasy based on research.' Set in the immediate future, and based on a wealth of research, there is little here that couldn't be achieved in this story. Nor are the speculations wholly invalid. The Piri Reis Map was assessed by cartographers who deemed most of its landforms as conforming to modern configurations. Jackson builds her story with care, staffing it with people we might encounter in any academic or government research facility. There are petty jealousies, intense emotion both attractive and repellent. The scientist's dedication to revealing the underlying elements of what appears to be fantastic is admirably displayed....In short, this is an adventuresome tale in a realistic setting. It's something to take up when you seek excitement. You won't be disappointed.</p>

				<h3>4&frac12; Hearts</h3>

				<p>&quot;Ice Tomb surprised me. I expected something interesting, but nothing near what the book actually gave. Once I began reading, I literally could not stop. And even with slight foreshadowing during the story, there were turns of events I didn't completely expect, a plus for any book. This story did have romance, but it was primarily a science-fiction mystery and adventure. The author used excellent suspense, as well as cutting back and forth between different characters to further the anticipation of coming events. I did have a few questions at the end, but they didn't alter the overall feeling after I finished the book. The plot was fairly unexpected and, to be clich&eacute;d, spine- tingling. Ice Tomb is the best science-fiction romance I've read lately, but in a completely different way from books in the same genre. The characters were strong and sometimes flawed, but also determined and willing to explore possibilities. There was definitely good use of characterization in this book. The action/adventure is what fueled the pace and story, rather than the romance. Yet the HEA was satisfying and I felt very happy over it. (I'd go into details, but that might spoil the book!) It's hard for me to give you detailed reasons why this book hit so many good spots with me without revealing the intricate plot, yet it will have to do. I just really loved the twists and turns Ice Tomb took me on.&quot; <a href="http://theromancestudio.com/reviews/reviews/icetombjackson.htm" target="_blank" class="arrows">Read More</a> </p>

				<p>&#8220;A new star is born and her name is Deborah

					Jackson. Her ICE TOMB opens like a whirlwind and then picks up

					speed. I can&#8217;t recall ever reading a novel that had me so

					intrigued so quickly. Read it somewhere warm and cozy, with snacks

					on hand. Once you start it, you won&#8217;t want to stop till it&#8217;s

					done. When you&#8217;ve finished it, you just might want to

				turn back to page #1 and start over.&#8221;</p>

				<h3>Highly Recommended</h3>

				<p>&quot;Jackson evidently researched this novel extensively--Antarctica, the moon, volcanoes, and quantum physics combine for an exciting read. The author's use of tension and conflict kept me interested until the surprising, but satisfying, ending.</p>

				<p>I highly recommend ICE TOMB to anyone who enjoys science fiction combined with a good mystery.&quot; <a href="http://www.roadtoromance.ca/reviews0502/reviewicetomb.htm" target="_blank" class="arrows">Read More</a> </p>

				<h3>					4 Stars--Very Well Done, Recommended</h3>

				<p>&quot;As I began reading this novel I had flashbacks to the beginning of the movie &quot;Alien VS Predator.&quot; Same hotspot far under the ice in Antarctica with a possible pyramid. However, that is the ONLY thing this novel has in common with that movie.</p>

				<p>It is obvious that the author did some serious research on a variety of topics in order to complete this story. The result is a wonderful piece of sci-fi that will stretch your imagination beyond its limits. Here is an author to keep your eye on!&quot; <a href="http://www.huntressreviews.com/scifi.htm" target="_blank" class="arrows">Read More</a> </p>

				<p>&quot;ICE TOMB is the equivalent of a summer blockbuster movie -&shy; nonstop action set in exotic locales ranging from Antarctica to the moon. If you want adventure, drama, personal conflict, and sex, it's all here.&quot;</p>

				<hr />

				<p>&quot;...I wondered whether she had read Blankenship et al. (1993) Active volcanism beneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Nature 361, 526-9? Big Brownie points here even if I have ice sheet stability problems with a part subterranean Antarctic base. Ditto personal problems with an episode of geological timing mentioned which was (northern hemisphere dominated Younger Dryas aside) one of climatic and ice sheet change as we were coming out of the last glacial, but your average SF reader (even if scientist other than one into climatology of biosphere science) simply would not know this. Ditto the iridium record...it will be interesting to see what she gives us in future years...&quot;</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Ms. Jackson entrances the reader by keeping the secret of the Antarctic just out of reach. The characters are well developed and easy to identify with. The science is plausible and well researched; she puts the S back into SF. Like Fredrick Pohl, Ms. Jackson weaves an immensely entertaining tale of intrigue and suspense.&rdquo;</p>

				<p><a href="#topOfPage" class="arrows">Back to top</a></p>

				<hr />

				<p>&quot;As a scientist I must admit that the author has captured the scientist mindset, and while a number of themes such as...aren't anything new, they are employed in a well-coordinated, entertaining and--for all the SF and fantasy that's been set in Antarctica--fairly original manner....Deborah Jackson does create believable characters and manages to present the more esoteric technologies without great gobs of exposition....a rapid pace and multidimensional characters who actually evolve make Ice Tomb eminently readable...&quot;</p>

				<h3>8.7 In the Library Reviews</h3>

				<p>&quot;From ancient mysteries to cutting-edge science and technology, Ice Tomb is in a word, unforgettable. Jackson writes with depth and clarity, making even the most scientific information understandable and interesting. Her blending of ancient cultures and myths along with the science and emotional aspects make Ice Tomb very hard to put down. Take it from me, clear your schedule, once you start reading, you'll not want to put down this superb tale.&quot;</p>

				<h3>Five Moons - Mystique Books</h3>

				<p>&quot;Wow! What can I say but 'Fantastic!' ICE TOMB leaps into action and doesn't let up until its stunning end with a character twist not seen since Babylon 5... If you're ready for a high stakes thrill ride based on sound science and a taste of the fantastic, then pick up ICE TOMB. Then buckle up for a hair-raising ride.&quot;</p>
