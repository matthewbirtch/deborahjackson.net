	    <p>&ldquo;<em>Zotz</em> was a  bat, but not just any bat, &ldquo;said Megan &ldquo;He was a vampire bat like those we saw in the cave above. In Mayan legend,  he played a part in the story of two brothers who upset the Lords of Death and  were forced to travel to the Underworld&mdash;called <em>Xibalba</em>. There they had to pass several death-defying tests. They  hid in the house of <em>Zotz</em>, but when  one of them peered out, <em>Zotz</em> swooped  down and tore off his head.&rdquo;</p>
	    <p>&ldquo;Lovely,&rdquo; said Kat.</p>
	    <p>&ldquo;Most of the Mayan legends are similarly gruesome. But in the story,  the other brother managed to reattach the head. In the end, they fooled the  Lords of Death . . .&rdquo;</p>
	    <p class="quote" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-weight: bold; text-align: center; color: #000000;">Mayan  legend, or not?</p>
<p>Kat  Delaney is a world class caver and microbiologist. While investigating one of  the deepest caves on Earth, she, along with her team of fellow cavers and  scientists, becomes trapped. Far below ruins of a Mayan city, they struggle to  escape this mysterious cave, reportedly cursed and haunted by The Lords of Death.  Kat&rsquo;s husband, Mark, a doctor and pioneer of nanotechnology with a deep-rooted  fear of caves, must try to rescue her. He enlists the help of a Mayan guide,  &nbsp;who turns out to have revolutionary ambitions.</p>
<p>Kat  must keep her unravelling team together when they discover that  something as threatening as the Lords of Death lurks within the cave. Mark  must choose between trusting a guide who is patently untrustworthy, or leaving  Kat to die.  Will they  escape? Will  science be the solution? Or will it simply affirm their sentence as the Lords  of Death win once again?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coincidentally, a team of archaeologists recently discovered a sinkhole filled with human skulls and bones. The images in <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/01/140116-maya-mexico-yucatan-cenote-bones-haunted-taboo-archaeology-science/" title="Mayan Sinkhole">this video</a> are remarkably similar to those I described in the book when I wrote the first draft.</p>

	    <p><span>Sinkhole begins as a parallel story of a couple that   has separated but need to come together again as the result of   incredible circumstances. Deborah Jackson has created Kat and Mark, a   wife and husband who drifted apart, and a supporting cast of characters,   each with his or her own goals and demons. Kat leads an expedition into   the deepest known cave system in order to locate microorganisms with   potentially healing capabilities. Kat, along with an archaeologist,   another scientist, and a caving enthusiast who happens to be in love   with her, plumb the depths of a sinkhole that was used by the ancient   Maya as a ceremonial pool for human sacrifices. Further into the depths   of the earth, they come face to face with hidden treasure &ndash;- a Mayan   king&rsquo;s burial chamber but also the source of a deadly pathogen. Mark, in   an effort to rescue his wife Kat, confronts his phobia of caves and   enlists the aid of a guide who has other, sinister reasons for reaching   the site and returning to the surface.<br />
        <br />
        Deborah Jackson explores a variety of human weaknesses and strengths as   she leads her characters through the sinkhole and beyond in their quest   for fame, fortune, and a miracle cure for disease. Sinkhole not only   features a place where the action occurs but also represents the depths   of the participants&rsquo; feelings, and an overall loss of humanity on the   part of one of the characters. The meaning of love, life, and loss are   explored as these explorers fight for their lives amidst amazing   discoveries, deep in the earth where no one had been for over a thousand   years.</span></p>

<hr />
		<p align="left">Riveting Novel by Deborah Jackson is a Page-turning Treat</p>
		<p align="left">With its fast-paced action and rich scientific  details, this thriller is a pleasure to read. &nbsp;In particular, I enjoyed  the fascinating references to biology, caving, microsurgery, revolutionary  politics and Maya culture, which were interspersed among a healthy dose of  exhilarating adventure.</p>
		<p align="left"><br />
		  &ldquo;(The novel) was based on research,&rdquo; Jackson tells  me in a phone interview, when I asked how she came up with the plot. &ldquo;I have  been to Mexico, but (the idea) came from a National Geographic article about  the race to the deepest caves in the world.&rdquo;</p>
		<p align="left"><br />
		  Her other scientific ideas, like surgery performed  by a nano-sized submarine, or bacteria with special healing powers, were also  derived from her extensive research. &nbsp;Jackson&rsquo;s reading clearly paid off,  as her detailed descriptions bring the caving experience to life.</p>
		<p align="left"><br />
		  In many parts of the book, I could feel the fear of  the trapped characters as they struggled through narrow tunnels, avoided deadly  bacteria, and&nbsp;crumpled to the ground in exhaustion from the immense  physical challenge posed by the cave....</p>
		<p align="left"><br />
		  Looking forward, Jackson is planning on releasing  another novel for young adults. &nbsp;&ldquo;My next project is with the editor and  is called <em>Mosaic</em>,&rdquo; she says.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a ghost-pirate story.&rdquo;</p>
		<p align="left"><br />
		  If the writing is anywhere near as good as&nbsp;<em>Sinkhole</em>,  it will be a book that will definitely be worth reading.</p>
