				<p>&quot;All kids have a sense of adventure. So why not give them an adventure in words?

				<p>&quot;Combining time travel technology, history and mystery, <em>Time Meddlers</em> is an enthralling science fiction story that transports readers from present day Ottawa back in time to the 1600s....Suspense, humour and memorable characters make this exciting adventure a page turner.&quot;</p>

				<h3>Recommended</h3>

						

	<p>&quot;The characters are very real, and the situations make the book quite a page turner. Can time travel change history? . . . Includes a glossary of Native tribes and terms, and a set of questions for reading groups.&quot;</p>

	<h3>5 Stars</h3>

	<p>An extremely well done story that will have you rethinking your ideas on quantum theories. Though the tale involves multiple universes and the possibility of time travel, it is told in such a way that kids as young as the age of eight can easily understand everything. The book is recommended by the publisher for children between ages eight and twelve. However, I believe that young adults (teens) will highly enjoy the story as well. </p>

	<p>The back of the book is filled with a short glossary, discussions for reading groups, and even some activities that could be done in the classroom. This novel is so exciting that kids will probably not even realize how much they are learning. Excellent! ***** <a href="http://www.huntressreviews.com/allkids.htm" target="_blank" class="arrows">Read More</a></p>

	<h3>Five Stars</h3>

	<p>Science fiction has long held a fascination for young, inquisitive minds. What are the alternative possibilities to everyday life? Is the course of history locked in some pattern or can individuals truly have an impact on how events transpire? Jackson poses these questions admirably, showing how the young can act on their own initiative and maintain a set of effective values. These two clash with adults, with each other and with their peers. But they also learn reconciliation and cooperation between themselves and a larger community. They understand how today's actions lead to tomorrow's results, and selfish behaviour can be carried only so far. This book is valuable for many reasons and an excellent &quot;stocking stuffer&quot; for any young person. Adults should find it of more than passing interest. </p>

	<h3>Four Stars</h3>

	<p>Jackson makes history fun with a story that takes us back to the 1600s and introduces us to Algonquins, Mohawks and more, while relating the land dispute that led to the dissemination of an entire race of natives. Her story is quick-paced and catchy, and it moves nicely from present day into the past, giving a vivid view of native life.

				<h3>5 Cups</h3>

				<p>&quot;This is an absolutely wonderful book. Although geared toward young adults, I believe adults will also enjoy this fast paced, adventuresome book. I know I did. Great friendships are made and history is re-written among the pages of this story. You are learning a history lesson while barely noticing. This is definitely a book worth your time.&quot; <u><a href="http://www.coffeetimeromance.com/BookReviews/Thetimemeddlers.html" target="_blank" class="arrows">Read More</a></u></p>

				<p>&ldquo;The Time Meddlers by Deborah Jackson is a book that is jam-packed with action and suspense. In this story every moment is crucial. There is so much reality that the time travel in this book seems possible. Deborah Jackson knows exactly what children would do in the situation in which she puts them. In short, this was a great book.&rdquo;</p>
