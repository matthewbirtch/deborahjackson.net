		<h3>Chapter One</h3>

		<h4>The Code</h4>

		<p>She was doing it again&mdash;tempting fate. No sane kid would go back in there. 

			No sane kid would blindly follow Matt, who dared cars to crash into him and 

			plunged into reckless adventures without a nibble of doubt or fear. Was that it? 

		Had she lost her cool, logical mind?</p>

		<p>Sarah shivered and paused at the threshold to Matt&rsquo;s old house. She sank 

			her teeth into her lip as she pushed the door a crack wider. She had to keep 

			going. Matt would notice if she lagged too far behind. She winced as the door 

			rasped on rusty hinges, then crept into the foyer, her powder blue sneakers 

			treading lightly on the hardwood floor. Not lightly enough, though, as a creak 

			leaped off the floor, ricocheted in the hall and up the massive, winding 

			staircase, mocking her like a witch&rsquo;s cackle. No matter what Matt said, this 

			house truly was haunted. A chill breeze swept through the corridor, lifting 

			ringlets of hair off the back of her neck and rustling past her to flutter over 

			Matt&rsquo;s bristly head. He didn&rsquo;t turn around or even seem to notice. He was 

			making for the stairs, his Nikes leaving definitive tread marks on the oak floor 

		like an animal&rsquo;s footprints in mud.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Matt. Take your shoes off,&rdquo; Sarah whispered.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he asked in a rather loud voice.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she said, pointing to the tracks he was leaving. &ldquo;What if Nadine&rsquo;s 

		around?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>			&ldquo;Nadine&rsquo;s long gone,&rdquo; said Matt. &ldquo;The cops are still searching for her. She&rsquo;s 

		probably in China by now.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be so sure. All of her belongings are still here. At some point she&rsquo;s 

			going to come back to get them. Now that the police aren&rsquo;t watching the house 

		anymore, this is her chance. What if she catches us snooping around?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what she could do to us. She&rsquo;s just one scrawny woman.&rdquo;		</p>

		<p>&ldquo;She did quite a bit of damage for one scrawny woman.&rdquo; Sarah shuddered. 

			She could never forget that evil woman with ice chips for eyes and a bony face 

			that, if it hadn&rsquo;t been coated with make-up all the time, would make her look 

			like a hag. Nadine had been Matt&rsquo;s guardian for the past twelve years since his 

			father had disappeared, but she had cared little for him, doing the bare 

			minimum to keep him clothed and fed. All she&rsquo;d cared about was gaining 

			control of the multiverse time machine&mdash;Matt&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s creation&mdash;and making 

		those who stood in her way disappear into the past.</p>

		<p> &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone now,&rdquo; said Matt, gazing at Sarah calmly. &ldquo;So we don&rsquo;t have to 

		worry.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; she said, still whispering.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;This is <em>my</em> house. We don&rsquo;t have to whisper. And we don&rsquo;t have to sneak 

		around like a couple of thieves.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Then why are you hunched over? And why are you walking on tiptoe?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Matt, straightening up and placing his feet squarely on the floor. &ldquo;Got me there. But hey, I kind of like being a detective.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Sarah smiled. &ldquo;Admit it, you&rsquo;d do anything for a thrill.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;And you always come with,&rdquo; he stated.</p>

		<p>Sarah eyed him narrowly, but she couldn&rsquo;t deny it. Why did she always have 

			to come with? Was it because they were best friends? Or was it the aura of 

			mystery or the sense of adventure&mdash;which always seemed to accompany him&mdash; 

			that she couldn&rsquo;t resist? Her heart pattered as she surveyed the gigantic 

		hallway of the decrepit mansion.</p>

		<p> &ldquo;Right,&rdquo; she said, looking away to conceal her frown. Well, at least there was 

			a good reason for her to consent to this little &lsquo;break and enter.&rsquo; Matt still 

			maintained hope that he could crack the code that Nadine had incorporated 

			into Dr. Barnes&rsquo;s&mdash;Matt&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s&mdash;computer. She&rsquo;d ensured that Dr. Barnes 

			would remain trapped in the past, using his own creation&mdash;the time machine&mdash; 

			against him. Sarah and Matt had been searching for this code for the past year, 

			ever since Matt had come to live with her and her father, but with no luck. 

			Scientists had been selected to assist him, but no matter how much they 

			battered at the wall Nadine had erected in the computer, they couldn&rsquo;t break it 

			down. But maybe, just maybe, they could find clues the police might have 

		missed in Nadine&rsquo;s personal paraphernalia.</p>

		<p>The stairs groaned as they mounted the spiral staircase. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sounds like a 

			banshee,&rdquo; said Sarah, giggling a little hysterically. Matt just rolled his eyes and 

			kept climbing. It looked like he was trying his best to climb casually, but soon 

			he&rsquo;d hunched over again and his toes barely touched the steps. He turned back 

		and winked.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;You really get into this, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Sarah.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t? I seem to remember you breaking into the lab last year.&rdquo; 

			Sarah ground her teeth into her lower lip, remembering, yes, that she, the 

			girl who always abided by the rules, had become somewhat of a delinquent 

			since she&rsquo;d met Matt. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not talk about it. Let&rsquo;s just find Nadine&rsquo;s code and 

			get the heck out of here.&rdquo; She&rsquo;d forgotten to whisper. Her words bounced off the 

		vaulted ceiling and seemed to rain down on her.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Shh,&rdquo; said Matt.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Nothing to worry about, he says,&rdquo; she muttered, tiptoeing into the hallway 

		close behind him.</p>

		<p>They stopped beside the elaborate French doors leading into Nadine&rsquo;s old 

			bedroom. Matt pushed them open hesitantly. A gush of stale air rushed into 

			the room, stirring up cobwebs and driving some scuttling insect out from under 

		the furniture.</p>

		<p> &ldquo;I swear this place is haunted,&rdquo; said Sarah. &ldquo;How did you ever live here?&rdquo;		</p>

		<p>Matt shrugged. &ldquo;You survive, I guess, with what you have. The house never 

			bothered me. Just Nadine.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>He walked purposefully into the obsessively ordered bedroom. Dust clouds 

		seemed to follow him.</p>

		<p>Sarah hung back for a second. Crossing this threshold seemed like crossing 

			into another time period. Nadine had state-of-the-art organizers, computers, 

			and video recorders on the desk she kept in her room. There wasn&rsquo;t a paper to 

			be seen, and everything was filed, even her make-up and perfume. Not a 

			wrinkle deformed her bedspread or a mislaid item of clothing spoiled the 

			creamy carpet. Sarah finally swallowed her reluctance, entered the room, and 

		walked over to the dark mahogany dresser.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; asked Matt. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to go through her 

		underwear, are you?&rdquo; He crinkled his nose.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The police have already looked in this room. If she left anything, it would 

		have to be hidden somewhere they&rsquo;d missed or didn&rsquo;t want to look through.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You can do it. I&rsquo;ll look through her desk.&rdquo; He opened the 

		top drawer of the matching mahogany desk.</p>

		<p>Sarah sorted through the drawer, lifting and shaking underwear, examining 

			pantyhose. She ran her hand along the bottom and back panel, but could find 

		nothing unusual. She slammed the drawer shut.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Anything?&rdquo; Matt asked.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Nothing but skimpy silk undies.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Matt shuddered.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;No luck,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Maybe we should try somewhere else.&rdquo; He gently clicked 

		the next drawer open. A slightly louder click came from downstairs.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Matt. Did you hear that?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;There was a noise downstairs. I think it was the front door.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>			&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; whispered Matt. &ldquo;I locked it after we came in.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;And who has the key?&rdquo; asked Sarah, raising her eyebrows.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said Matt, shaking his head vigorously. &ldquo;Not good.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to hide.&rdquo; Sarah looked frantically around the room. She dove for 

			the closet door at the same time as Matt. They scrambled inside and pulled the 

			door toward them just as a floorboard creaked on the second floor of the house. 

			Sarah and Matt peeked through the crack they had left between the door 

			and the jamb. A thin scarecrow of a woman thrust her high forehead and 

		narrow nose through the French doors into the room.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Bloody kids,&rdquo; she muttered, her greasy blonde hair hanging in tangled clots 

			around her face. Devoid of make-up and creased with frown lines, her face was 

			like a white mask. This was nothing like the Nadine that Sarah remembered. It 

			seemed that life as a fugitive had wreaked havoc on the formerly immaculate 

		woman.</p>

		<p>Nadine wobbled on the chipped heels of her pumps toward her dresser. She 

			wrenched open a drawer and withdrew underwear and knee-highs. &ldquo;Bloody 

		miserable kids,&rdquo; she muttered.</p>

		<p>Matt made a motion with his hand around his ear. Sarah nodded.</p>

		<p> Nadine turned abruptly and headed for the closet. Sarah and Matt quickly 

			backed up&mdash;it seemed forever&mdash;in the enormous walk-in until they hit a wall. 

			Long evening gowns hung beside them in the corner. They snuggled in behind 

			the silk layers and puffy taffeta, trying not to rustle the material. Sarah held 

			her breath as Nadine teetered into the closet-warehouse and thrust aside 

			dresses and suits. She shrank toward Matt as the woman came dangerously 

			close to their corner. Finally Nadine withdrew some items of clothing and 

			stumbled back into the room. The door to the closet remained ajar.		</p>

		<p>Matt and Sarah sighed quietly and rested their heads together, but Sarah 

			sensed something in Matt that was more than just fear. His neck and 

			shoulders appeared tight, his eyes narrowed with intensity. Sarah tried to 

			snare Matt&rsquo;s arm as he sneaked out from behind the gowns and crept toward 

			 

			the opening. Matt shook her hand off. It seemed like he&rsquo;d come to a decision 

			and she probably wasn&rsquo;t going to like it. He pantomimed attacking Nadine, 

			making punching motions.		</p>

		<p>Sarah shook her head. Was he crazy? That woman was evil. There was no 

		telling what she would do.</p>

		<p>Matt clenched his fist.		</p>

		<p>Sarah grabbed his arm again, pleading silently for him to reconsider. Matt 

			looked at Nadine, now hunched over her make-up table trying to repair her 

			face, then back at Sarah. She shook her head again. Why couldn&rsquo;t he see that 

			this was madness?		</p>

		<p>Matt ground his fist into his hand. With his chin thrust out, he crept up to 

			the door. Sarah stepped in behind him and peered over his shoulder. Nadine 

			was getting up from the table, her icy blue eyes now enhanced with dark 

			eyeliner. She crossed over to a mirror beside her bed. Strange. She&rsquo;d just spent 

			five minutes gazing at her reflection in front of her make-up table. Why was she 

			looking in another mirror? Sarah puckered her brow as the woman reached out 

			and caressed the smooth surface. She must see more in that ghastly face than 

			Sarah did. With a jerk Nadine slid the mirror aside to reveal a square steel door 

			with a dial on the right-hand side. A safe! She spun the dial right, then left, 

			then right. Click. It opened. She reached inside and clamped her spindly fingers 

			on a dark object with a bluish sheen.		</p>

		<p>Matt coiled back, ready to spring on her, but he froze at the last second. 

			Sarah peered over his shoulder and sucked in a gasp.		</p>

		<p>The object was a <em>gun</em>.		</p>

		<p>Sarah yanked Matt back into the closet, clamping a hand over his mouth.		</p>

		<p>Nadine moved as a distant shadow through the room, the gun extending 

			from her hand like an additional appendage. Any thought Matt might have had 

			about jumping her seemed to have sped out of his mind. He was heaving 

			silently, his eyes flicking from Nadine in the other room to Sarah with her hand 

			still clenching his mouth. They heard a click as Nadine released the clip to 

			 

			check if the gun was loaded. She slammed the magazine back into the pistol. 

			The snap echoed throughout the room and seemed to drum right into Sarah&rsquo;s 

			head. It was getting harder and harder to breathe. She couldn&rsquo;t believe it when 

			Nadine touched her lips to the barrel, then slowly lowered her arm and aimed 

			at the closet.		</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stop you kids,&rdquo; she snarled. &ldquo;One of these days . . .&rdquo; She laughed&mdash;an 

			eerie high-pitched laugh that sent chills down Sarah&rsquo;s spine.		</p>

		<p>Nadine tucked the gun into her purse and walked out the door, leaving the 

			safe wide open. Her sneer was still vividly imprinted in Sarah&rsquo;s mind as she 

			heard the front door slam shut.		</p>

		<p>Matt sighed loudly. Sarah couldn&rsquo;t seem to catch her breath. She was 

			gasping, hyperventilating. &ldquo;I . . . don&rsquo;t . . . feel . . . so good.&rdquo;		</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo; said Matt, grasping her arms and making her face him. &ldquo;Calm 

			down. She&rsquo;s gone. We&rsquo;re okay.&rdquo;		</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I . . . thought she . . . was going . . . to shoot us.&rdquo;		</p>

		<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; said Matt, &ldquo;but she didn&rsquo;t really see us. She only pictured us in 

			her mind. We&rsquo;re safe for now.&rdquo;		</p>

		<p>&ldquo;For now,&rdquo; panted Sarah.		</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Besides, what kind of detective are you if you can&rsquo;t face the wrong end of a 

			gun barrel once in a while?&rdquo;		</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Matt. I just decided. I don&rsquo;t want to be a detective anymore.&rdquo; 

			Matt let go of her arms and walked into the room.		</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Matt. I&rsquo;m waiting for you to say the same thing.&rdquo; 
			Matt didn&rsquo;t answer. Sarah reluctantly left the shelter of the closet.		</p>

		<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;		</p>

		<p>He was heading for the safe.		</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Have you flipped out? Let&rsquo;s get out of here.&rdquo;</p>

		<p> 

			&ldquo;I think she left something behind.&rdquo;		</p>

		<p>Sarah shuffled after him and peered into the murky black hole. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see 

			anything.&rdquo;		</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Voila!&rdquo; Matt held up a spool of film the size of a large button.		</p>

		<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked.		</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s microfilm. This might be our code.&rdquo;		</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Why would she use microfilm? It&rsquo;s way outdated.&rdquo;		</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s kind of strange, but then again, she&rsquo;s kind of strange. I don&rsquo;t 

			really care as long as I&rsquo;ve got something to go on now.&rdquo; Matt&rsquo;s face seemed 

			radiant as he clasped the film to his chest. He peered into the safe again and 

			removed another small object, instantly recognizable by its rounded tip and 

			blunt bottom.		</p>

		<p>&ldquo;A bullet,&rdquo; Sarah gasped. She backed up a step.		</p>

		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not going to bite,&rdquo; said Matt, &ldquo;unless it&rsquo;s in a gun.&rdquo;		</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I hate guns.&rdquo;		</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we have to worry about guns or Nadine anymore,&rdquo; he said. 

			&ldquo;Because, with this,&rdquo; he threw the microfilm up in the air and caught it, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m 

		going to set my dad free.&rdquo;</p>
