		    <p><strong>Abu Simbel and the  Aswan Dam</strong></p>
            <p><strong><img src="Images/Abu Simbel, Holger Weinandt.jpg" width="517" height="263" /> </strong></p>
            <p><a href="http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/abusimbel.htm">Abu Simbel</a> consists of two monumental rock temples in southern Egypt along the  Nile approximately 290 km southwest of Aswan. <strong>The Great Temple of Ramses II</strong>,  mentioned in <em><a href="timeMeddlersonthenile.html">Time Meddlers on the Nile</a></em>,  is fronted by four immense seated statues of Ramses II carved into the mountain,  directly from the sandstone bedrock. It's aligned in such a way as to allow the  sun's rays to penetrate the temple and illuminate Ramses' sanctuary twice a  year on October 22 and February 22.</p>
            <p>A 19th dynasty pharaoh of Egypt, <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aes/c/colossal_bust_of_ramesses_ii.aspx">Ramses  II</a> ruled for 67 years during the 13th century BCE, and constructed a wealth  of monuments along the Nile banks, as well as modifying previous constructions.  He began to build the temple complex in approximately 1284 BCE, an enterprise that took 20 years. It was one of six rock  temples erected in Nubia during this era. The complex was called &quot;Temple  of Ramesses, beloved by Amun.&quot;</p>
            <p>William Y Adams suggested in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nubia-Corridor-William-Y-Adams/dp/0691093709/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1313765254&sr=1-1">Nubia, Corridor to Africa</a>, that not only  traditional Nubians resided near Abu Simbel and the fortress of <a href="http://www.globalegyptianmuseum.org/glossary.aspx?id=99">Buhen</a>, but also possibly the <a href="http://oi.uchicago.edu/museum/nubia/cmedjay.html">Medjay</a>, ancient warriors for the  Egyptian pharaohs, raiders and occasionally farmers along that stretch of the  Nile at different time periods. Near Buhen, he discovered pan graves, oval-shaped,  that were unique and suggested a cultural sub-group of Nubians. I found this  archaeological evidence fascinating, particularly after tracing the Medjay  forward and backward through time. See my <strong><a href="timeMeddlersonthenilehistoricalnote.html">Historical  Note</a></strong> to learn more about my research.</p>
            <p>Suffice it to say, the Medjay were  originally known for their policing habits, particularly protecting Egyptian  temples and palaces.</p>
            <p>Over time the temples of Abu Simbel  became buried in sand. At first, around the 6th century BCE, the statues of the  main temple were covered up to their knees, revealing an odd group of legless  pharaohs. Sand continued to rise and soon obliterated most of the temple.  Finally, in 1813, Swiss orientalist  J.L. Burckhardt discovered the top frieze of the main temple. Burckhardt  discussed his discovery with Giovanni Belzoni, an Italian explorer in Egypt at  the time, who then travelled to the site, but couldn't unearth the entrance. In  1817, Belzoni returned and managed to dig out the entrance and explore the  complex. He confiscated everything he could remove.</p>
            <p>Eventually Egyptologists and tourists  began to visit Abu Simbel and marvel at it. But in 1959 this relic, along with  several other remnants of Egyptian civilization and Nubian culture, were about  to be destroyed. The construction of the <a href="http://geography.about.com/od/specificplacesofinterest/a/nile.htm">Aswan  High Dam</a> was imminent and rising flood waters that would eventually become  Lake Nasser threatened to obliterate the temple. UNESCO set out to rescue the  site, among a few others, and begged the world's assistance in donations. Thus  the Abu Simbel temples were salvaged from 1964 to 1968 at a cost of 80 million  dollars USD. Both temples and part of the mountain were cut into large blocks,  dismantled and reassembled 65 m  higher and 200 m back from the river, in what many consider one of the greatest  feats of archaeological engineering.</p>
            <p><img src="Images/Abu Simbel facade.jpg" width="490" height="418" /></p>
            <p>Abu Simbel consists of two temples. The <strong>Temple of Ramses II</strong>, is of greater  size and therefore the most impressive. Devoted to three Egyptian gods at the  time: Ra-Harakhty, Ptah and Amun, the facade is thirty-three meters high and  thirty-eight meters wide, and guarded by four twenty-meter statues of Ramses II.  At some point in history, an earthquake damaged one of the statues, leaving only  the lower portion intact, but the head and torso still rest complacently at the  statue's feet. Twenty-two baboons are sculpted at the top, their arms raised in  supplication to the rising sun. Inside, eight statues of Ramses II, modeled  after the god Osiris, serve as pillars&mdash;mentioned in <em><a href="timeMeddlersonthenile.html">Time Meddlers on the Nile</a></em> when Sarah is kidnapped and trapped in  the temple.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Abu Simbel</em></strong><em>, she thought, awestruck, despite her situation. Made by Ramses II. The  statues' soaring height bedeviled Sarah's eyes, making her feel like she was  walking under the throne of a god. Many gods, actually, since there were four  seated statues of Ramses with smaller replicas of Nefertari and possibly  Ramses' mother and other royal women, even a prince, sculpted beside and  between his feet. The men prodding her forced her up a ramp, then stopped at a  massive wooden door sealing the temple entrance. In astonishment Sarah watched  as they produced a golden key to unlock the door.</em></p>
            <p><em>. .  . They steered her to the right and thrust her to the ground. She couldn't see  anything until one of the men lit a torch and held it high, illuminating  brilliant frescoes of the pharaoh and Egyptian gods along with a number of  hieroglyphs. More detailed statues of Ramses II bordered the path, grim-faced  guardians to the temple's entrance.</em></p>
            <p>The interior of this temple is fashioned in a triangular layout, with  rooms that shrink in size from the wide entrance to the tapered sanctuary.</p>
            <p>The smaller temple, the <strong>Temple of Nefertari</strong>, is dedicated to  the goddess Hathor, personified in Ramses' most beloved wife Nefertari (the  pharaoh had 200 wives and concubines). Six statues, four of Ramses II and two  of Nefertari, guard the entrance. All six are the same height, an odd  arrangement that may indicate how deeply Ramses adored and respected his  favourite wife.</p>
            <p><br />
              <strong>The Aswan High Dam and Lake Nasser</strong></p>
            <p><br />
              <img src="Images/Aswan dam.jpg" width="485" height="170" /></p>
            <p>When Egypt built the high dam to  prevent the cyclical flooding of the Nile&mdash;which threatened people who lived  along the Nile banks&mdash;they didn't anticipate the complications that would  follow. The rich soil that gives Egypt its wealth of fertile land along the  Nile banks came from the Ethiopian highlands transported through the Blue Nile,  and now the salinity of the river has increased and the rich soil can no longer  reach Egypt. How did Egypt rise to such power and become an advanced  civilization in the past? Because it could provide ample food for its people.</p>
            <p>In order to build this dam, the land  behind it was flooded&mdash;Nubian land. Nubia contains dozens of  archaeological sites that were threatened, twenty-four temples, fortresses and  tombs, including <strong>Dendour Ellessiya</strong>,<strong> Amada</strong> and <strong>wadi al-Sebowa</strong>. Very few were moved, most notably <a href="http://www.drhawass.com/photoblog/philae-temple">Philae</a>, <strong>Kalabsha</strong> and, as mentioned above, <strong>Abu Simbel</strong>. </p>
            <p><img src="Images/Abu Simbel, before and after dam, Zureks.jpg" width="494" height="348" /></p>
            <p>When the Aswan Dam was constructed in the 1960s,  over 100,000 Nubians became displaced. Some moved north into Egypt, and others  south into Sudan. New Nubia is located in the reclaimed desert area known as  Kom Ombo. Egyptian Nubia was originally made up of forty-three villages along the  Nile River over an area of 350 kilometers. It covered a stretch of land from  the First Cataract at Aswan to the Sudanese border town of Wadi Halfa. Today,  New Nubia exists in an area five kilometers long and five kilometers wide. </p>
            <p>Before the dam was constructed, a number of  planet-wide missions began excavating for the buried treasures beneath Nubian  soil. Many monuments were saved, some re-erected near their original locations  on high ground (such as Abu Simbel), a number of others moved to Khartoum in  the Sudan, while some small temples were actually given away to foreign governments who participated in the rescue  operation. The temple of<strong> Dendur</strong></a> now resides in the  Metropolitan Museum of Art in <strong>New York</strong>,  the <strong>Temple of Debod</strong> is currently  located at City Park in <strong>Madrid Spain</strong>,  the rock cut temple of <strong>el-Lessiya</strong> is  at Museo Egizio in <strong>Turn, Italy</strong>, the  gateway of the temple of <strong>Kalabsha</strong></a> in the Agyptisches  Museum in <strong>Berlin, Germany</strong>, and the <strong>Taffa Temple</strong> at Rijksmuseum van  Oudheden in <strong>Leiden, Netherlands</strong>. A  temple from <strong>Semna, kumma</strong> (Semna  East), two of the temples located at the famous (and now infamous) fortress of <strong>Buhen</strong>, a temple from <strong>Aksha</strong> (Serra West) and the rock cut  tomb of <strong>Djehutihotpe </strong>were all moved  to <strong>Khartoum</strong> in the Sudan. These  temples and artefacts were rescued. But what about those that weren't, and are  now buried under Lake Nasser?</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Lost artifacts</strong></p>
            <p><br />
            <strong>Quban (Kuban)</strong></p>
            <p> <img src="Images/Quban.jpg" width="504" height="647" />Quban  once towered over the east bank of the Nile across  from the temple of Dakka</a>, just south of  the First Cataract, a strategic location for trade and protection from marauders.  This fortress was likely constructed during the 12th Dynasty</a> by Senusret I</a> (1971-1926 BCE), but it might have had an Old Kingdom (2686-2160 BCE) component. Three circular walls with rounded  bastions surrounded the fortress. Additions were made during the reign of  Ramses II. To add to its unfortunate demise, the temple was constructed of  mudbrick, a cheaper and easier material to mold in hot climates. This made it  virtually impossible to save&mdash;I do believe that excavating mudbrick would be a  dubious enterprise. During the New Kingdom</a> (1550-1070 BCE), Quban became more vital to Egypt and its trolling  for resources, since it was located near the <strong>gold mines</strong> of <strong>Wadi 'Allaqi</strong>.  Several temples were protected within Quban's walls, but little archaeological  investigation was done and any further knowledge is irretrievable.</p>
            <p><strong>Faras  (Pachoras)</strong></p>
            <p>Now  submerged under Lake Nasser, Faras was founded during the Middle Kingdom  (2040-1750 BCE), and was simply a small fortress at the time. In the New  Kingdom period (1550-1070 BCE) a number of small temples were added, including  an 18th Dynasty (1341-1323 BCE) temple of Tutankhamun. The town  might have been known as Hathor of Ibschek, referring to a particular temple  dedicated to the goddess. It has been suggested that this temple was originally  constructed by Tuthmosis III (someone I may be writing about in the future). In  later years, Tutankhamun and Ramesses II saw the temple enlarged to  contain a square courtyard with a portico on each side, a hypostyle hall with  twelve columns and a sanctuary.</p>
            <p><img src="Images/Nubian fortress Faras fresco.jpg" width="500" height="321" /></p>
            <p>During  the third century, the time of the Mero&euml; kingdom (800 BCE &ndash; 350 AD), Faras  became a more prominent town known as Paharas or Pachoras. Archaeologists  suspect it may have been a provincial capital from the first century BCE to the  first century AD, after the discovery of a palace, settlement and royal  burials. From the seventh century onward it became the capital city of  Christian bishops in Nubia. A cathedral, six other churches, a monastery, and  pottery workshops were erected at the site. Before the construction of the dam,  120+ Byzantine-Coptic style  paintings in tempera on dry plaster were rescued, many of which are now housed  in Sudanese museums and the National Museum in Warsaw. </p>
            <p><strong>Mirgissa</strong> </p>
            <p><img src="Images/Mirgassa fort.jpg" width="479" height="358" /></p>
            <p>Mirgissa was located in the  region of the Nile's second cataract on the west bank of the river, fifteen  kilometers south of Wadi Halfa. Here, a small New Kingdom temple of Hathor was erected, perhaps replacing an earlier Middle Kingdom structure. Originally known as Iken, it possessed several large well-built  granaries. An inscription from the fort of Semna reads as follows:</p>
            <p><em>The southern boundary which was created in the 8th year under the  Majesty of Senusret III to prevent any Nubian from passing it when faring  northwards, on foot or by boat, as well as any cattle of the Nubians. An  exception is a Nubian who shall come to barter at Iken, or one with an official  message.</em></p>
            <p>The Medjay, mentioned in <em><a href="timeMeddlersonthenile.html">Time Meddlers on the Nile</a></em> and in my<a href="timeMeddlersonthenilehistoricalnote.html"> <strong>Historical Note</strong></a>,&nbsp; patrolled the desert at this time for the  Egyptians. (Remember they acted as policemen for the Egyptians during the  Egyptians' rule of Nubia.) They were presumably paid partly in grain. So it is  suggested that Mirgassa may have been a major site for trade, but marked a  boundary which Nubians weren't allowed to cross. An interesting temple, which  no longer exists.</p>
            <p>Of course, the list of possible  archaeological sites that were lost to the waters of Lake Nasser are more than  simply numerous. As Adams relates in his book, <em>&quot;Four thousand years after  their building, and three thousand years after their final abandonment, the mud  walls of these gargantuan relics still rose, in places, over forty feet above  the desert sand. With Abu Simbel, they rank among the foremost monuments to  Egyptian enterprise in Nubia or anywhere else. But whereas Abu Simbel has been  saved, to UNESCO's and the world's credit, the fortresses have disappeared  without a trace beneath the waters of the Nile.&quot;</em> Many graves that would  give archaeologists more insight into Nubian culture and traditions were also drowned.</p>
